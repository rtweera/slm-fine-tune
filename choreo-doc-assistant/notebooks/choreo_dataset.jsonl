{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is the purpose of the CNAME record when configuring a custom domain?", "output": "A CNAME (Canonical Name) record is used in DNS (Domain Name System) to create an alias for a domain name. When configuring a custom domain in Choreo, the CNAME record serves to map your custom domain to the target domain provided by Choreo. This is essential for redirecting requests from your custom domain to the appropriate Choreo services, ensuring that users can access your components seamlessly under your branded domain.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of how it fits into the process of configuring a custom domain in Choreo:\\n\\n1. **Adding a Custom Domain**: When you add a custom domain for your organization in the Choreo Console, you will receive a generated CNAME target value.\\n2. **Creating the DNS Record**: You need to create a DNS record with your domain provider that associates your custom domain with the provided CNAME target value. This tells DNS servers that requests for your custom domain should be directed to the Choreo infrastructure.\\n3. **Verification**: After setting up the CNAME record, you can verify the mapping in the Choreo Console. If the mapping is correct, you'll be able to proceed with configuring TLS certificates and finalizing the setup.\\n\\nThis process allows components such as APIs and web applications to be accessible through a custom URL that reflects your brand, enhancing discoverability and credibility.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions on configuring a custom domain in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is the difference between importing a TLS certificate and using Let's Encrypt?", "output": "In Choreo, there are two main methods for handling TLS certificates when configuring a custom domain: importing a TLS certificate and using Let's Encrypt. Here's a breakdown of the differences between the two:\\n\\n### Importing a TLS Certificate\\n- **Manual Management**: When you choose to import a TLS certificate, you are responsible for managing the certificate lifecycle, including renewal and updates.\\n- **Certificate Requirements**: The imported certificate must meet specific guidelines:\\n  - It should be issued by a recognized certificate authority (CA) and include the public key along with other details such as domain name, owner information, expiration date, and the CA's digital signature.\\n  - The certificate must be in X.509 format and in PEM format.\\n  - It can be a direct certificate for a specific domain or a wildcard certificate covering subdomains.\\n- **Additional Files**: When importing, you may also need to provide:\\n  - A TLS key file (must be in PEM format and RSA encrypted).\\n  - A certificate chain file, if necessary, to ensure clients can verify the server's SSL/TLS certificate.\\n  \\n### Using Let's Encrypt\\n- **Automated Management**: By opting for Let's Encrypt, Choreo will automatically generate and manage the TLS certificates for your custom domain. This includes handling renewals, which can alleviate the administrative burden associated with certificate management.\\n- **Simplicity**: This option is generally simpler for users who may not want to deal with the complexities of certificate generation and management, as it requires minimal setup on the user's part.\\n\\nIn summary, if you import a TLS certificate, you take on the responsibility for its management and compliance with specific standards. In contrast, using Let's Encrypt allows Choreo to automate the process, providing ease of use and less administrative overhead.\\n\\nFor more details on configuring a custom domain and the TLS certificate options, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What are the different mapping levels for access control in Choreo?", "output": "In Choreo, access control is managed using a combination of **Roles**, **Groups**, and **Mapping levels**. The mapping level defines how roles are assigned to groups within the context of the Choreo Console. There are two distinct mapping levels for access control:\\n\\n1. **Organization Level**:\\n   - At this level, a role can be assigned to a group within the entire organization. This means that all users in the assigned group inherit the permissions granted by that role across all organizational resources.\\n   - For example, if a user has the `edit_project` permission at the organization mapping level, that user can edit all projects within the organization.\\n\\n2. **Project Level**:\\n   - This level allows for role assignments limited to a specific project. Users in a group will inherit the permissions granted by that role only within the specified project.\\n   - For instance, if a user has the `edit_project` permission at the project mapping level, that user can only edit the specified project.\\n\\nIt's important to note that organization-level permissions take precedence over project-level permissions. Therefore, careful management of role assignments is essential to prevent unintended access.\\n\\nFor a more comprehensive overview of access control in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation: [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is the purpose of JWKS support in Choreo?", "output": "The purpose of JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) support in Choreo is to facilitate the validation of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) by providing a set of public keys that can be used to verify the signatures of those tokens. This is essential for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the claims contained within the JWTs during communication between services.\\n\\n### Functionality of JWKS in Choreo:\\n\\n1. **Public Key Endpoint**: Choreo offers specific endpoint URLs for retrieving the JWKS, which includes the public keys necessary for validating JWTs. For example, endpoints for the US East and EU regions are:\\n   - [US East](https://gateway.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/.wellknown/jwks)\\n   - [EU North](https://gateway.e1-eu-north-azure.choreoapis.dev/.wellknown/jwks)\\n\\n   For private data planes (PDPs), the endpoint follows the template:\\n   ```\\n   https://<PDP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN>/.wellknown/jwks\\n   ```\\n   Here, `<PDP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN>` needs to be replaced with the appropriate domain configured for the PDP APIs.\\n\\n2. **Dynamic Key Management**: JWKS allows for the dynamic rotation of keys, meaning that the issuer (e.g., an identity provider) can change the keys without requiring the recipient to hard-code these keys in their application. The recipient can simply fetch the latest public keys from the JWKS endpoint.\\n\\n3. **Key Identification**: Each key in the JWKS has a `kid` (Key ID) that corresponds to a property within the JWT. This allows the application to select the correct public key for validating the JWT based on the `kid` value.\\n\\n4. **JWKS Response Structure**: The JWKS response provides a JSON object containing an array of keys. Each key includes several properties:\\n   - `kty`: The key type (e.g., RSA).\\n   - `e`: The exponent value of the public key.\\n   - `use`: The purpose of the key (e.g., for signing).\\n   - `kid`: The key identifier for matching.\\n   - `alg`: The algorithm used with the key.\\n   - `n`: The modulus value of the public key.\\n\\n   Here is a sample structure of a JWKS response:\\n   ```json\\n   {\\n     \"keys\": [\\n       {\\n         \"kty\": \"RSA\",\\n         \"e\": \"AQAB\",\\n         \"use\": \"sig\",\\n         \"kid\": \"unique_key_identifier\",\\n         \"alg\": \"RS256\",\\n         \"n\": \"modulus_value\"\\n       }\\n     ]\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n### Summary\\nIn summary, JWKS support in Choreo enhances security by providing a reliable way to verify JWTs through public key retrieval and dynamic key management. This ensures that services can authenticate requests securely and efficiently.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation: [JWKS support in Choreo to validate the JWT](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/pass-end-user-attributes-to-upstream-services/#jwks-support-in-choreo-to-validate-the-jwt)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What are the steps for implementing sign-in functionality in a web application with managed authentication?", "output": "To implement sign-in functionality in a web application using Choreo's managed authentication services, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n### Step 1: Set Up Managed Authentication for Your Web Application\\n\\n#### 1.1 Implement the Sign-In Functionality\\nYou need to create a sign-in button in your web application that redirects users to the Choreo authentication URL when clicked. Here\u2019s a sample code snippet for this button:\\n\\n```javascript\\n<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = \"/auth/login\" }}>Login</button>\\n```\\n\\nWhen the button is clicked, users are redirected to the configured identity provider where Choreo handles the authentication process. Upon successful sign-in, relevant session cookies are set, and users are redirected to a specified post-sign-in path (default is `/`).\\n\\n#### Optional: Pass Additional Query Parameters\\nIf you need to pass additional parameters to the identity provider, you can modify the login URL like this:\\n\\n```javascript\\n<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = \"/auth/login?fidp=myfederatedidp\" }}>Login</button>\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Configure the Identity Provider\\nYou need to configure the identity provider that your web application will use. This can either be the built-in identity provider provided by Choreo or an external one that supports OIDC/OAuth2.0.\\n\\n1. Go to your component in the Choreo Console.\\n2. Click on **Settings**.\\n3. Under the **Authentication Keys** tab, select your identity provider and generate the necessary authentication keys.\\n\\n### Step 3: Enable Managed Authentication\\nWhen deploying your web application, ensure that managed authentication is enabled:\\n\\n1. In the Choreo Console, go to your web application component.\\n2. Click **Deploy**.\\n3. In the **Set Up** card, click **Configure & Deploy**.\\n4. Make sure the **Managed Authentication with Choreo** toggle is enabled and fill in the necessary fields, including post-login paths.\\n\\n### Step 4: Obtain User Information Claims\\nAfter sign-in, you can access user information claims either via a cookie or by invoking a GET resource. Here\u2019s how to retrieve user information from the `userinfo` cookie:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport Cookies from 'js-cookie';\\n\\n// Read userinfo cookie value.\\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo')\\n\\n// Decode the value.\\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo))\\n\\n// Clear the cookie after use.\\nCookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> })\\n```\\n\\nAlternatively, you can retrieve user information by calling the `/auth/userinfo` endpoint:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5: Implement Sign-Out Functionality\\nTo allow users to sign out, create a sign-out button that redirects them to the logout path:\\n\\n```javascript\\n<button onClick={async () => {\\n    window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`;\\n}}>Logout</button>\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Considerations\\n- Make sure to handle session expiry and implement a custom error page if needed.\\n- For more detailed steps and examples, refer to the Choreo documentation on [setting up managed authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-your-web-application).\\n\\nThese steps will help you successfully implement the sign-in functionality using Choreo's managed authentication services.

This button facilitates the authentication process with Choreo's identity provider. Here's a basic example using JavaScript:\\n\\n```javascript\\n<button onClick={() => {window.location.href=\"/auth/login\"}}>Login</button>\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Obtain User Information Claims\\nOnce the user successfully signs in, you can access their information claims in two ways:\\n\\n#### A. Via the `userinfo` Cookie\\nChoreo's managed authentication establishes a `userinfo` cookie upon successful sign-in. This cookie contains encoded user information claims, which can be accessed as follows:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport Cookies from 'js-cookie';\\n\\n// Read userinfo cookie value.\\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');\\n\\n// Decode the value.\\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));\\n\\n// Store the value in a preferred browser-based storage if needed.\\n\\n// Clear the cookie.\\nCookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> });\\n```\\n\\n**Note:**\\n- The `userinfo` cookie has a short lifespan of 2 minutes.\\n- It is important to securely store any user information retrieved.\\n\\n#### B. Via the GET Endpoint\\nChoreo also provides a GET endpoint at `/auth/userinfo` to retrieve user claims. You can fetch this information as follows:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');\\nif (response.ok) {\\n    const userInfo = await response.json(); // Contains user information in JSON format\\n} else {\\n    // Handle unauthorized access\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Response Codes:**\\n- `200 OK`: User information is returned in JSON format.\\n- `401 Unauthorized`: Indicates the user is not signed in.\\n\\n### 3. Additional Information\\nEnsure you have configured the identity provider correctly and enabled managed authentication for your web application component. This setup is essential for the user claims retrieval functionality to work correctly.\\n\\nFor further details on setting up managed authentication and configuring identity providers, you can refer to the documentation: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively obtain user information claims in your Choreo-managed web application."}

If a user attempts to invoke a Choreo API after their session has expired, they will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response status. This indicates that the session may have expired and the user needs to re-login.\\n\\n2. **Automatic Re-login Logic**: You can implement logic to automatically redirect users to the login page when a `401 Unauthorized` response is detected. Here\u2019s a sample code snippet that shows how to wrap your API requests with this re-login logic:\\n\\n   ```javascript\\n   export const performGet = async (url) => {\\n       try {\\n           // Attempt to make the API call\\n           return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>');\\n       } catch (error) {\\n           if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {\\n               // If a 401 error occurs, redirect to the login page\\n               window.location.href = \"/auth/login\";\\n           } else {\\n               throw error; // For other errors, throw them to be handled elsewhere\\n           }\\n       }\\n   };\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Configuring Session Expiry Time**: You can set the session expiry time during the deployment of your web application. It is essential to ensure that this value matches the refresh token expiry time of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) application you are using. During deployment, you can specify the session expiry time in minutes, with a default of 10080 minutes (7 days).\\n\\n4. **Custom Error Handling**: If you want to redirect users to a custom error page in case of session expiry or other errors, you can define a custom error path in your authentication settings. If an error occurs during the sign-in or sign-out process, Choreo will redirect users to this custom error page.\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nBy implementing the automatic re-login logic and setting appropriate session expiry times, you can effectively manage session expirations in your web applications using Choreo's managed authentication. This ensures a seamless user experience even when sessions expire.\\n\\nFor more detailed steps on managing authentication in web applications with Choreo, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-your-web-application)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I manage and revoke personal access tokens?", "output": "In Choreo, managing and revoking personal access tokens primarily involves understanding the nature of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) used for authentication. Here's how you can effectively manage and revoke these tokens:\\n\\n### Managing Personal Access Tokens\\n1. **Token Expiration**: It is advisable to set a short expiration time for access tokens\u2014no longer than 15 minutes (900 seconds) by default in Choreo. This minimizes the risk if a token is stolen or leaked.\\n   \\n2. **Token Generation**: When you create an application in Choreo, you can generate credentials that include a consumer key and secret. These can be used to generate access tokens for API access.\\n\\n3. **Refresh Tokens**: Regularly refreshing access tokens reduces the potential impact of a compromised token. \\n\\n### Revoking Personal Access Tokens\\nRevoking JWT access tokens is inherently challenging since they are self-validating. Traditional session-based authentication allows for easy revocation via session IDs, but JWTs do not have this capability. Here are some strategies:\\n\\n1. **Using Denylists or Allowlists**: To revoke a token, you might need to implement denylists (to block specific tokens) or allowlists (to permit only certain tokens). However, this approach can complicate the authentication process.\\n\\n2. **Short-Lived Tokens**: As mentioned, keeping tokens short-lived and refreshing them frequently is the best practice to mitigate risks associated with stolen tokens.\\n\\n3. **API Access**: To revoke an access token, you can invoke the designated revoke endpoint in your application settings.\\n\\nFor a step-by-step guide on generating tokens and managing credentials, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on generating keys](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/create-an-application/#step-2-generate-keys).

They are useful for services that require access to various components within the same project.\\n   \\n2. **Component Connections**: These connections are specific to a single component and cannot be used by other components. They are ideal for scenarios where a component needs to connect to a particular external service or legacy system.\\n\\n### Creating Connections\\nTo integrate a service on Choreo:\\n1. **Creating a Connection**:\\n   - In the Choreo Console, you set the visibility level (project or component).\\n   - You navigate to the **Dependencies** section and then to **Connections**.\\n   - From there, you can create a new connection by selecting a service from the Marketplace, specifying details like name, description, access mode, and authentication scheme.\\n\\n2. **Connection Parameters**:\\n   - Upon creating a connection, Choreo provides a Connection ID and connection parameters.\\n   - You can configure your service to use this Connection ID and map the parameters to environment variable names in your component. These variables can then be accessed programmatically in your service implementation.\\n\\n3. **Dynamic Injection**:\\n   - At runtime, Choreo dynamically injects values into the environment variables based on the configured mapping. This design promotes loose coupling, making it easier to maintain and modify connections without altering the service code.\\n\\n### Utilizing Connections\\n- Services can utilize these connections to communicate with each other, share data, or perform actions seamlessly.\\n- For instance, when a service needs to connect to another service, it leverages the Connection ID to retrieve the necessary parameters at runtime, allowing for smooth interaction without hardcoding sensitive information.\\n\\nIn summary, connections in Choreo enhance the ability to build integrated applications by allowing services to communicate effectively while maintaining flexibility and security.

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is the purpose of Deployment Tracks in Choreo?", "output": "Deployment Tracks in Choreo serve as structured pathways for the deployment of software components, enhancing both organization and reliability throughout the deployment process. They are designed to provide practical solutions to improve the API consumer experience by addressing two primary challenges: streamlined deployment and efficient API versioning.\\n\\n### Purpose and Functionality of Deployment Tracks\\n\\n1. **Streamlined Deployment**:\\n   - **CI/CD Integration**: Deployment Tracks are connected to specific branches within a GitHub repository, facilitating deployment to various environments. When a pull request (PR) is merged, it can automatically trigger a deployment to the development environment.\\n   - **CD-Only Strategy**: For users who prefer to manage their own Continuous Integration (CI) systems, Deployment Tracks can be utilized as Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines. They can be linked to a container registry repository, allowing for seamless deployment of images directly from that repository.\\n\\n   ![Deployment tracks - source repo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks-source-repo.png)\\n\\n   ![Deployment tracks - container registry](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks-container-registry.png)\\n\\n2. **Efficient API Versioning**:\\n   - Deployment Tracks provide a straightforward method for versioning APIs, which is particularly beneficial for managed APIs. They follow a versioning mechanism based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer), allowing developers to specify major and minor versions. This approach helps minimize disruption for API consumers while continuously deploying updates.\\n   - Changes that do not introduce breaking modifications are categorized as patch updates, while major and minor versions are communicated to API consumers through the deployment tracks.\\n\\n   ![Deployment tracks - api versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks-api-versioning.png)\\n\\nBy utilizing Deployment Tracks, developers can better manage and control the deployment process, ensuring that their components are deployed smoothly and effectively, while also maintaining clear versioning for API consumers.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Deployment Tracks](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/)."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How does Choreo's API versioning mechanism work?", "output": "API versioning in Choreo is designed to efficiently manage and deliver different versions of APIs, particularly for service components. Here's an overview of how it works, along with best practices and features related to managing API versions:\\n\\n### Versioning Mechanism\\n1. **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**: Choreo utilizes a versioning convention based on Semantic Versioning. The version format includes only the major and minor versions, prefixed with `v` (e.g., `v1.2`).\\n   - **Major Version**: Incremented when there are incompatible changes to the API.\\n   - **Minor Version**: Incremented when functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.\\n\\n2. **Deployment Tracks**: Choreo provides a feature called Deployment Tracks that simplifies the management of API versions. Each deployment track can specify the major and minor versions of the API being delivered. This structure ensures that different versions can coexist and interact seamlessly, benefitting both API developers and consumers.\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n- **Minimize Disruption**: When deploying updates, it is crucial to minimize disruption for API consumers. Changes that do not introduce breaking modifications are categorized as patch updates; these should ideally not affect clients.\\n- **Communicate Changes**: While API consumers are primarily concerned with major version changes, it's important to communicate any minor version changes as they may still impact clients.\\n- **Internal Versioning**: For internal tracking, developers can utilize Git tags or GitHub releases to manage versions effectively.\\n\\n### API Lifecycle Management\\nChoreo also incorporates an API lifecycle management system that includes six distinct states: \\n- **Created**\\n- **Pre-released**\\n- **Published**\\n- **Blocked**\\n- **Deprecated**\\n- **Retired**\\n\\nThis lifecycle management allows API managers to optimize the development process and ensure that subscribers have access to the latest and most reliable versions of APIs.\\n\\n### Subscription Management\\nWhen subscribing to an API, the subscription covers all minor versions within the API's major version. This means that when a new minor version is published, existing client applications can continue to function without disruption, as the invocation URL routes automatically to the latest minor version.\\n\\n### Visual Representation\\nThe following image illustrates the API versioning approach in Choreo:\\n\\n![Deployment tracks - API versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks-api-versioning.png)\\n\\nFor more detailed information on API versioning and lifecycle management in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Efficient API Versioning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/deployment-tracks/#efficient-api-versioning)\\n- [API Lifecycle Management](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/lifecycle-management/)"}

It allows for experimentation and development without affecting live services.\\n\\n2. **Production Environment**: Once services are verified in the development environment, they can be promoted to the production environment. This environment is where the services are live and accessible to end users.\\n\\nChoreo provides these environments as part of a streamlined continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process. Each project in Choreo is provisioned with these two default environments. If you are using a private data plane, you have the flexibility to create and customize additional environments based on your specific requirements.\\n\\nChoreo adopts a *build once, deploy many* strategy, meaning that your application is built once and can be promoted to multiple environments as needed.

Here's a comprehensive overview of how this process works:\\n\\n1. **Components and Environments**: Each component you create is associated with a specific project, and environments are provisioned per project. When a component is deployed, it is packaged as a container and deployed to the specified environment. After deployment, you can promote the container image across the various environments available for that project.\\n\\n2. **CI/CD Process**: Choreo supports a streamlined continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process. It allows you to manage your deployments efficiently across multiple environments. Each project has its own environments, and these environments are isolated from one another, which means services deployed in one environment cannot communicate with services in another.\\n\\n3. **Build Once, Deploy Many**: Choreo adopts a \"build once, deploy many\" strategy. This means that an application is built only once (either automatically on each commit or manually based on a selected commit). After building, the component is promoted to other environments, allowing you to test changes in lower environments, like development, before moving to production.\\n\\n4. **Promoting Components**: To promote a component from one environment to another (e.g., from development to production), you typically need to request approval. You'll need to ensure that your component is built and deployed in the initial environment (development). The steps generally include:\\n   - Selecting the component in the Choreo Console.\\n   - Requesting to promote it to the desired environment (such as production).\\n   - Providing necessary details in the approval request.\\n\\n5. **Redeploying a Release**: If you need to redeploy a component to a specific environment, you can do so by accessing the Runtime page and using the \"Redeploy Release\" option. This action will trigger a rolling update, syncing all the latest changes to the environment.\\n\\nFor further details, you can check the relevant documentation:\\n- [Components and Environments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/resource-hierarchy/#components-and-environments)\\n- [CI/CD](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/)\\n- [Request Approval for Environment Promotion](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/submit-and-manage-workflow-approval-requests/#request-approval-for-environment-promotion)\\n- [Redeploy a Release](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/view-runtime-details/#redeploy-a-release)"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What OAuth 2.0 grant types does Choreo support?", "output": "Choreo supports several OAuth 2.0 grant types for authentication, which are essential methods for client applications to obtain an access token. Here\u2019s a list of the supported grant types:\\n\\n1. **Authorization Code Grant**: This flow allows a client application to obtain an access token securely without exposing user credentials. The user authenticates with the authorization server, which issues an authorization code that can be exchanged for an access token.\\n\\n2. **Refresh Token Grant**: This grant type is used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. Refresh tokens are issued alongside access tokens and can be used to request new access tokens without user interaction.\\n\\n3. **Client Credentials Grant**: This type allows client applications to obtain an access token without user authentication. It is mainly used when the application needs to access its own resources.\\n\\n4. **Implicit Grant**: In this flow, a client application can obtain an access token directly from the authorization server without an intermediate authorization code exchange. However, it is less secure and generally not recommended for applications requiring high security.\\n\\n5. **Password Grant**: This grant type allows a client application to obtain an access token by directly providing the user's username and password to the authorization server. It's typically used in trusted applications but is less secure compared to other methods.\\n\\nThese grant types provide flexibility depending on the application type and security requirements.

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I configure endpoints for services and integrations in Choreo?", "output": "To configure endpoints for services and integrations in Choreo, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n### Understanding Endpoints\\nEndpoints are crucial as they define how your service or integration is exposed to other services, integrations, or applications. Each endpoint can represent a unique entry point, and you can expose multiple endpoints for different purposes, such as REST and GraphQL APIs.\\n\\n### Key Attributes of Endpoints\\nWhen configuring endpoints, you need to focus on several attributes:\\n- **Name**: A unique identifier for the endpoint within the service component.\\n- **Port**: The network port on which the endpoint is accessible.\\n- **Type**: The protocol used by the endpoint (e.g., REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.).\\n- **Network Visibility**: This determines who can access the endpoint (Project, Organization, or Public).\\n- **Schema**: This specifies the structure and format of data exchanged through the endpoint.\\n- **Context**: This is applicable for HTTP and GraphQL endpoints and allows you to add a context path for routing.\\n\\n### Configuring Endpoints\\nThe method you use to configure endpoints can depend on the buildpack you are using. Here are the main approaches:\\n\\n1. **Using the Choreo Console**:\\n   - If you do not have a `component.yaml` file, you can define a basic endpoint configuration when creating the component.\\n\\n2. **Using the `component.yaml` File**:\\n   - Create a `component.yaml` file and place it in the `.choreo` directory at the build context path, then commit it to your source repository. This file allows you to manually define endpoint details.\\n   - Note: If you need to define dynamic endpoint parameters (like variable ports), you must use the `component.yaml` file as automatic generation does not support these.\\n\\n3. **Exposing Service Endpoints** (for service components):\\n   - After creating your service component, you can define the endpoints during a manual deployment:\\n     1. In the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.\\n     2. Click **Update Image & Deploy** in the **Build Area** card.\\n     3.

If the liveness probe fails, the container is restarted automatically. This is particularly useful for scenarios where the application may have crashed or become unresponsive, allowing the system to self-heal.\\n- **Behavior**: These probes run periodically and will trigger a restart of the container if they indicate that the application is not healthy.\\n\\n### Readiness Probes\\n- **Purpose**: Readiness probes determine if your application is ready to handle requests. If a readiness probe fails, the container will stop receiving network traffic, but it will not be restarted. This is useful for ensuring that traffic is only directed to containers that are fully initialized and capable of processing requests.\\n- **Behavior**: These probes also run periodically but focus on stopping traffic to the container rather than restarting it.\\n\\n### Key Differences\\n- **Restart Behavior**: Liveness probes restart the container upon failure, while readiness probes only prevent traffic from reaching the container.\\n- **Traffic Management**: Readiness probes are crucial for managing incoming requests and ensuring that only healthy instances serve traffic, while liveness probes focus on overall container health.\\n\\nBy implementing both probes, you can effectively monitor and manage the state of your applications within Choreo, ensuring high availability and reliability.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation links:\\n- [Set Up Health Checks - Liveness Probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#liveness-probes)\\n- [Set Up Health Checks - Readiness Probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#readiness-probes)"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is the purpose of autoscaling component replicas?", "output": "The purpose of autoscaling component replicas in Choreo is to ensure high availability and efficient resource utilization for applications or services deployed on the platform. Autoscaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of active replicas of your components based on resource consumption metrics, such as CPU and memory utilization. This means that as demand fluctuates, Choreo can scale the number of replicas up or down accordingly.\\n\\n### Benefits of Autoscaling:\\n1. **High Availability**: By scaling replicas, your service can handle varying loads, ensuring that it remains responsive even during peak usage times.\\n2. **Resource Efficiency**: Autoscaling optimizes the use of resources by minimizing costs. For instance, during low traffic, fewer replicas can be maintained, thus consuming less infrastructure.\\n3. **Dynamic Response to Load**: The system can automatically increase the number of replicas when resource thresholds are reached, allowing it to adapt to sudden spikes in usage without manual intervention.\\n4. **Lower Infrastructure Costs**: Particularly in environments where the load is variable, autoscaling can significantly reduce costs by scaling down idle workloads.\\n\\n### Key Parameters for Scaling:\\n- **Min Replicas**: The minimum number of replicas that should be maintained at all times. It is recommended to set this to at least `2`.\\n- **Max Replicas**: The maximum number of replicas to scale up to. For cloud data planes, this is restricted to a maximum of `5`, while there is no restriction in private data planes.\\n- **CPU and Memory Thresholds**: These thresholds determine when to scale up replicas. If the average CPU or memory usage exceeds the set threshold, additional replicas will be created until usage falls below the threshold.\\n\\n### Scale-to-Zero Feature:\\nChoreo also provides a scale-to-zero feature for HTTP applications, allowing them to scale down to zero when there is no traffic. This is particularly useful for reducing costs in lower environments. When a request is received, the application quickly scales up from zero to handle the load, making it a flexible solution for managing resources effectively.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on autoscaling component replicas, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-component-replicas/). Additionally, for insights into the scale-to-zero functionality, check out this link: [Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/)."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How does scale-to-zero work in Choreo?", "output": "The scale-to-zero feature in Choreo is designed to optimize resource utilization for HTTP applications and services by automatically scaling down to zero when there is no incoming traffic. This feature is particularly beneficial in reducing infrastructure costs, especially in lower environments where workloads may be idle for extended periods.\\n\\n### How Scale-to-Zero Works:\\n1. **Automatic Scaling**: When enabled, your application will scale down to zero replicas if it does not receive any HTTP traffic. Upon receiving an HTTP request, the application scales up from zero to handle the request, starting with one replica.\\n2. **Idle Timeout**: If the application remains idle (i.e., no requests) for approximately 5 minutes, it will automatically scale back down to zero. This process ensures that resources are not unnecessarily consumed when the application is not in use.\\n3. **Dynamic Scaling**: The application can dynamically scale up to meet high traffic demands, up to a specified maximum number of replicas. If the number of pending requests exceeds the defined threshold (default is set to 100), Choreo will add additional replicas to handle the increased load.\\n\\n### Benefits:\\n- **Cost Efficiency**: By scaling down idle workloads to zero, it significantly reduces operational costs, especially in development and testing environments.\\n- **Resource Optimization**: It allows efficient use of resources by ensuring that components are only active when needed.\\n\\n### Implementation Details:\\n- **Supported Applications**: The scale-to-zero feature is only available for HTTP applications and web services. It does not support TCP or HTTPS services.\\n- **Port Requirements**: For your HTTP service to utilize scale-to-zero, it must be deployed on specific ports (e.g., 5000, 6000, 7000, etc.). Services running on unsupported ports will not scale to zero.\\n- **Proxy Service**: When your application is scaled down, an intermediary proxy service holds incoming requests. This proxy intercepts requests and queues them until the application scales back up, after which the requests are forwarded to the application.\\n- **Initial Delay**: The first request after a period of inactivity may experience delays due to the scaling process. If your application is part of a service chain, the waiting time may extend further.\\n\\n### Limitations:\\n- Scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a service on a project scope if scale-to-zero is enabled; they must be set to HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) mode or no scaling mode.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the scale-to-zero feature, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#how-scale-to-zero-works-in-choreo)."}

Here are the steps:\\n\\n1. **Provide Basic Details**:\\n   - Choose whether to register at the organization or project level.\\n   - Navigate to **Dependencies** and then to **Third-Party Services**.\\n   - Click **+ Register**.\\n   - Enter a **Name** and **Version**.\\n   - Upload the service definition file to automatically detect the service type.\\n   - Verify the **Service Type**.\\n\\n2. **Define Endpoints**:\\n   - Click **Define Endpoints** after providing the service details.\\n\\n### Step 2: Define Service Endpoints\\nEndpoints are crucial as they contain the necessary parameters required to connect to the service. To define service endpoints, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Under **Define New Endpoint**:\\n   - Enter a **Name** for the endpoint.\\n   - Enter the **Endpoint URL**.\\n\\n2. Under **Additional Parameters**:\\n   - Add any parameters required to connect to the service, such as API keys or authorization tokens.\\n   - If you want to keep a parameter confidential, select the **Secret** checkbox.\\n\\n3. **Select Environments**:\\n   - Choose the environments where the endpoint should be accessible. This restricts service consumers to create connections only from the selected environments.\\n\\n4. Click **OK** to save the endpoint.\\n\\n5. To add more endpoints, click **+ New Endpoint** and repeat the above steps.\\n\\n6. Finally, click **Register**. Once you define at least one endpoint, the service will be automatically listed in the Internal Marketplace.\\n\\n### Important Notes:\\n- Ensure you have all necessary details from the service provider, including the API specification and service URL, before starting the registration process.\\n- If you want to manage the service later (update or remove), you can find it in the **Third-Party Services** list under **Dependencies**.\\n\\nFor further details, you can refer to the official documentation: [Register a third-party service in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/integrate-and-manage-external-services/integrate-and-manage-third-party-services/#register-a-third-party-service-in-choreo)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is the difference between HTTP and TCP probes?", "output": "In the context of monitoring and observability within Choreo, HTTP and TCP probes serve different purposes for assessing the health of your services. Here's a detailed comparison:\\n\\n### HTTP Probes\\n- **Type**: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on your service.\\n- **Success Criteria**: A successful probe is indicated by a response status code in the range of 200-399. This means that the service is operational and able to respond to HTTP requests.\\n- **Configuration**: You can configure additional HTTP headers based on your requirements. It is recommended to create a dedicated endpoint, such as `/healthz` or `/health`, to handle these probes. This allows for more straightforward health checks tailored to your service's needs.\\n- **Use Case**: Ideal for services that rely on HTTP protocols and need to verify that their endpoints are reachable and responsive.\\n\\n### TCP Probes\\n- **Type**: This probe attempts to establish a TCP connection to the container on a specified port.\\n- **Success Criteria**: If the probe cannot establish a TCP connection, it is considered a failure. There are no specific response codes to interpret; the ability to open a socket is the sole indicator of health.\\n- **Use Case**: Useful for services where TCP connectivity is crucial, regardless of whether an HTTP service is running. This is particularly relevant for non-HTTP protocols or for checking if the service is up and accepting connections.\\n\\n### Summary\\nIn summary, HTTP probes are focused on the application level, checking if specific endpoints are responding correctly, while TCP probes are concerned with the network level, ensuring that a service is reachable on a specified port. Depending on your service architecture and requirements, you may choose to implement one or both types of probes for comprehensive health monitoring.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Probe Types](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#probe-types)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I define users and assign them to groups?", "output": "In Choreo, managing users and assigning them to groups involves defining user roles and creating groups that can inherit these roles. Here's how you can define users and assign them to groups, along with details on the user management and group assignment processes:\\n\\n### User Management in Choreo\\n\\n1. **Roles**: Choreo roles define a set of permissions. There are predefined roles in Choreo such as:\\n   - **API Publisher**: Can manage APIs (create, publish, delete).\\n   - **API Subscriber**: Can subscribe to applications and manage subscriptions.\\n   - **Admin**: Responsible for administration tasks, including user management.\\n   - **Developer**: Can develop and manage cloud-native applications.\\n\\n2. **Groups**: A group is a collection of users who share similar roles. When you assign a role to a group, all users in that group inherit the permissions associated with that role. Predefined groups include:\\n   - **API Publisher**\\n   - **API Subscriber**\\n   - **Admin**\\n   - **Developer**\\n\\n### Assigning Users to Groups\\n\\nTo assign users to groups, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Create a Group**: \\n   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the **Settings** section.\\n   - Click on the **Access Control** tab and then the **Groups** tab.\\n   - Click **+ Create Group**, enter the group name and description, and click **Create**.\\n\\n2. **Assign Roles to the Group**: \\n   - After creating the group, you need to assign roles to it.\\n   - In the **Groups** tab, find your group and click the edit icon.\\n   - Click **+Add Roles**, select the appropriate roles, and click **Add**.\\n\\n3. **Add Users to the Group**:\\n   - To add existing users, navigate to the **Users** tab under **Access Control**.\\n   - Search for the user you want to add, click the edit icon next to their name, and select the group to which you want to add them.\\n   - If inviting new users, click **+Invite Users**, enter their email addresses, select the group, and click **Invite**.\\n\\n### Important Considerations\\n\\n- Ensure that roles assigned to groups are appropriate for the level of access needed within the organization or specific project.\\n- Avoid assigning multiple roles to a single user across different projects to prevent unintended access.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBy managing users and their roles through groups, you can efficiently control access and permissions in Choreo, ensuring that users have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks while maintaining security.\\n\\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Manage user permission](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/organization/#manage-user-permission)\\n- [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How does Choreo bill for platform services?", "output": "The billing model for platform services in Choreo is based on two primary structures: **hourly billing** and **fixed pricing**. Here are the key points to consider:\\n\\n### 1. Hourly Billing\\n- **Usage-Based:** You are billed based on the number of hours a resource is active. For instance, if you create a database, cache, or Kafka service and remove it within the same month, you will only pay for the hours it was active.\\n\\n### 2. Fixed Pricing\\n- **Service Plans:** Pricing varies according to the selected service plan. Choreo does not charge extra for network bandwidth usage, which means you can use the services without worrying about additional costs related to data transfer.\\n\\n### 3. Service Types\\n- Choreo allows you to create various platform services such as:\\n  - **Databases:** PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.\\n  - **Caches:** Choreo-managed cache instances.\\n  - **Kafka Services:** Managed Apache Kafka services across major cloud providers.\\n\\n### 4. Payment Considerations\\n- The billing for platform services is incorporated into your existing subscription with Choreo. Costs are determined by the specific service plan and the amount of resources utilized.\\n\\n### 5. Upgrade Options\\n- If you wish to upgrade your service plan, you will need to contact Choreo support for assistance.\\n\\nIt is important to be aware that the capability to create Choreo-managed databases, caches, and Kafka services is available only to paid Choreo users. Additionally, Choreo offers a 7-day free trial for all database types on the 'Hobbyist' service plan, which is available to free-tier users.\\n\\nFor further details, you can refer to the [Choreo Platform Service Billing and Upgrades documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/choreo-platform-services-billing-and-upgrades/)."}

You can overwrite existing secrets at any time. This is the recommended approach for sensitive data like database passwords or API keys.\\n   - **Configurations**: These can be read and updated via the Choreo Console, making them suitable for non-sensitive data.\\n\\n2. **Storage**:\\n   - All configurations and secrets are stored in an encrypted secret vault managed by WSO2. If you are using a private data plane, they will be stored in your chosen cloud environment's key management service (like Azure Key Vault or AWS Secret Manager).\\n\\n### Best Practices for React Applications\\nWhen dealing with a Single Page Application (SPA) like React, there are specific considerations:\\n\\n- **Baking-in Environment Variables**: Choreo does not support embedding sensitive secrets directly into the client-side code as anything mounted will be accessible to users. Therefore, avoid including sensitive secrets that are not browser-safe.\\n\\n- **Runtime Configuration**:\\n   - Create a `config.js` file in the `public` directory of your React application containing non-sensitive runtime configuration variables, such as API endpoints or feature flags.\\n   - Reference these variables in your React components using the `window.config` object.\\n\\n   Example of `config.js`:\\n   ```javascript\\n   window.config = {\\n       apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',\\n       featureFlags: {\\n           enableNewFeature: true,\\n           enableExperimentalFeature: false,\\n       },\\n   };\\n   ```\\n\\n### Updating Configurations or Secrets\\nTo update an existing configuration or secret within Choreo:\\n\\n1. In the Choreo Console, select the component you want to modify.\\n2. Navigate to **DevOps** > **Configs & Secrets**.\\n3. Click the edit icon next to the configuration or secret you wish to update.\\n4.

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What steps can I take to protect my web app?", "output": "To protect web applications in Choreo, consider implementing the following recommended security practices based on OWASP guidelines and Choreo's managed authentication features:\\n\\n### 1. Authentication and Authorization\\n- **Managed Authentication**: Utilize Choreo's managed authentication to simplify the integration of authentication and authorization into your web application. This includes setting up sign-in and sign-out functionalities that adhere to OIDC/OAuth2.0 protocols.\\n  \\n- **Short-lived Tokens**: Use short-lived JWT access tokens, ideally with an expiry time of no more than 900 seconds. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access if a token is compromised. Implement refresh tokens to allow users to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating.\\n\\n### 2. Secure Token Management\\n- **Encryption and Storage**: Ensure strong encryption for tokens and use secure storage methods to protect them from unauthorized access or leaks.\\n\\n### 3. Input Validation and Rate Limiting\\n- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent common attacks such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This includes setting constraints on data types and sizes.\\n  \\n- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your APIs. This helps mitigate the risk of denial-of-service attacks.\\n\\n### 4. Use of HTTPS\\n- **Always Use HTTPS**: Ensure that all communications between clients and servers are conducted over HTTPS to protect sensitive data from being intercepted during transmission.\\n\\n### 5. CORS Configuration\\n- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Properly configure CORS headers to control which domains can access your APIs. This mitigates risks associated with unauthorized cross-origin requests.\\n\\n### 6. JWT Best Practices\\n- **JWT Security**: Ensure that JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are signed and possibly encrypted. Follow best practices for JWT usage, such as avoiding insecure algorithms and ensuring proper validation of tokens.\\n\\n### 7. Secure Error Handling\\n- **Define Error Responses**: Implement clear and secure error handling mechanisms, including defining schemas for all response types, especially error responses. This prevents leaking sensitive information through error messages.\\n\\n### 8. Session Management\\n- **Session Expiry Handling**: Implement logic to handle session expiry gracefully. Automatically redirect users to re-login when their session has expired to maintain security.\\n\\n### 9.

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?", "output": "In Choreo, there are several methods available for API protection and security, focusing primarily on authentication and authorization. Here are the key methods:\\n\\n1. **Using External Identity Providers (IdP)**:\\n   - **Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**: Organizations can integrate Azure AD with Choreo for identity and access management. This involves setting up Azure AD to authenticate API invocations and assigning scopes to the API.\\n   - **Asgardeo**: Similar to Azure AD, Asgardeo can be used as an external IdP to authenticate API invocations. It also allows the assignment of scopes to an API within Choreo.\\n\\n   For detailed steps on integrating with these IdPs, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n   - [Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-azure-ad/)\\n   - [Secure API Access with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/)\\n\\n2. **Built-In Security Token Service**:\\n   - Choreo provides a built-in security token service that simplifies security testing. This service allows developers to test APIs with permissions in non-critical environments, utilizing features that generate scopes based on roles and user groups. \\n\\n   For more information on testing secure API access using Choreo's built-in capabilities, check out the following documentation:\\n   - [Test Secure API Access with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/)\\n\\n3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:\\n   - RBAC is a flexible method for managing access to API resources by assigning specific roles to users or groups. This method helps control what authenticated users can do and can be implemented using Choreo along with Asgardeo.\\n\\n   To learn more about implementing RBAC in Choreo, refer to the following tutorial:\\n   - [Secure an API with Role-Based Access Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/secure-an-api-with-role-based-access-control/)\\n\\nThese methods help ensure that APIs are protected against unauthorized access and that users can only perform actions that they are permitted to do."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I rotate personal access tokens regularly for better security?", "output": "To rotate personal access tokens regularly in Choreo for enhanced security, you can follow these best practices:\\n\\n1. **Use Short-Lived Tokens**: Set an expiry time for your access tokens to be no longer than 15 minutes (900 seconds). This minimizes the window of opportunity for unauthorized access if a token were to be compromised. By default, Choreo sets the token lifespan to 15 minutes, but you can configure this to be shorter based on your security needs.\\n\\n2. **Implement Refresh Tokens**: Use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens once the current ones expire. Refresh tokens can be generated alongside access tokens and allow your application to request new access tokens without requiring user interaction. This is particularly useful in maintaining a secure and seamless user experience. Ensure that refresh tokens are treated with the same level of security as access tokens.\\n\\n3. **Revoke Tokens When Necessary**: If you suspect that a token has been compromised, you should revoke it immediately to prevent unauthorized access. Choreo provides the capability to revoke access tokens, which is crucial for maintaining security.\\n\\n4. **Use Secure Storage**: Store your tokens securely to prevent unauthorized access. This includes using secure encryption methods and ensuring that tokens are not exposed in logs or front-end code.\\n\\n5. **Regularly Monitor and Rotate Keys**: Regularly monitor the usage of your tokens and consider rotating your consumer keys and secrets periodically to enhance security.\\n\\nBy following these practices, you can rotate personal access tokens effectively and enhance the overall security of your applications in Choreo.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Revoking Access Tokens](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#revoke-access-tokens) and [Grant Types](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#grant-types)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is the difference between internal and external APIs in Choreo?", "output": "In Choreo, the differences between internal and external APIs primarily concern their usage, functionality, and access:\\n\\n### Internal APIs\\n- **Usage**: Internal APIs are designed for use within an organization. They facilitate communication between different services and applications that are part of the same organizational structure.\\n- **Functionality**: These APIs allow internal services to interact securely without exposing sensitive data or functionalities to the outside world.\\n- **Access**: Access is restricted to users and applications within the organization. You can set the network visibility of an API endpoint to \"Organization,\" ensuring that only components within the same organization can access it.\\n\\n### External APIs\\n- **Usage**: External APIs are intended for public use, allowing external consumers to interact with a service. They are exposed to the outside world and can be used by applications or users outside the organization.\\n- **Functionality**: These APIs provide functionalities that can be consumed by third-party applications. They often include additional features such as API management, throttling, and analytics.\\n- **Access**: Access is open to any client, regardless of their organization. When exposing an endpoint as an external API, you set the network visibility to \"Public.\" This allows broader access while ensuring proper security measures, such as authentication and authorization, are in place.\\n\\n### API Management Features\\nBoth internal and external APIs can leverage Choreo's API management features, which include:\\n- Full lifecycle management of APIs\\n- API throttling\\n- Secure APIs with industry-standard authorization flows\\n- API analytics and monitoring\\n\\nTo expose endpoints as managed APIs in Choreo, you must configure their network visibility appropriately, allowing them to be accessed either internally or externally.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the relevant documentation: \\n- [Expose endpoints as managed APIs](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/#expose-endpoints-as-managed-apis)\\n- [Configure endpoints in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/configure-endpoints-body/)"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I configure mutual TLS between components in Choreo?", "output": "To configure mutual TLS (mTLS) between components in Choreo, you need to follow a series of steps to generate the necessary certificates and set up the communication. Here's a structured overview of the process:\\n\\n### 1. Understanding Mutual TLS\\nMutual TLS is a security protocol that enables both the client and server to authenticate each other using digital certificates. This ensures privacy, integrity, and authentication of the data exchanged between them.\\n\\n### 2. Generate Certificates\\nYou will need to create the following certificates:\\n\\n- **Root Certificate**: This is a trusted certificate used to verify other certificates during the mTLS handshake. You can generate a root certificate using tools like OpenSSL.\\n  \\n- **Client Certificate**: This certificate identifies the client. Ensure that the common name (CN) in the certificate correctly represents the client's identity, and it must be signed by the root certificate.\\n  \\n- **Server Certificate**: This certificate is used by clients to verify the server's identity. Similar to the client certificate, it must also be signed by the root certificate. When generating the server certificate, specify the server's hostname in the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). You can find this hostname on the Overview page of your project.\\n\\n### 3. Read Mutual TLS Certificates from Your Component\\nComponents can read the mutual TLS certificates either from the file system or through environment variables. Ensure that you save the private key as a secret for security purposes. For detailed instructions on handling configurations and secrets, refer to the Choreo documentation on [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets).\\n\\n### 4. Sample Implementation\\nFor a practical example, you can refer to the sample project demonstrating mutual TLS communication between services. Check the repository at [service-to-service-mtls](https://github.com/wso2/choreo-samples/tree/main/docker-service-to-service-mtls).\\n\\n### Diagram of Mutual TLS Authentication\\nTo visualize how mutual TLS works, the following diagram illustrates the authentication process:\\n\\n![Mutual TLS authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/authentication-and-authorization/mutual-ssl-authentication.png)\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nBy following these steps, you can establish secure communication between your components using mutual TLS in Choreo.

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I secure web applications with managed authentication?", "output": "To secure your web applications with managed authentication using Choreo, you can follow these key steps:\\n\\n### 1. Set Up Managed Authentication\\nChoreo's managed authentication simplifies the integration of authentication and authorization into your single-page web applications. It follows the backend for frontend (BFF) architecture, ensuring that OAuth tokens remain secure.\\n\\n#### Step 1.1: Implement the Sign-In Functionality\\nYou need to implement a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path when clicked. Here is an example code snippet:\\n\\n```javascript\\n<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = \"/auth/login\"; }}>Login</button>\\n```\\n\\nThis code will redirect users for authentication through the configured identity provider. Upon successful sign-in, Choreo will set session cookies and redirect the user to the specified post-sign-in path.\\n\\n#### Step 1.2: Obtain User Information Claims\\nAfter sign-in, you can retrieve user information from the `userinfo` cookie or the `/auth/userinfo` endpoint. \\n\\nExample to get user info from the cookie:\\n```javascript\\nimport Cookies from 'js-cookie';\\n\\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');\\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));\\nCookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> });\\n```\\n\\n#### Step 1.3: Implement Sign-Out Functionality\\nFor sign-out, implement a sign-out button that redirects to the `/auth/logout` path:\\n\\n```javascript\\n<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button>\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Enable Managed Authentication\\nTo ensure your web application utilizes managed authentication, enable it during the deployment process:\\n\\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane of the Choreo Console, select your web application.\\n2. Click on **Deploy** in the left navigation menu.\\n3. In the **Set Up** card, ensure the **Managed Authentication with Choreo** toggle is enabled and set the necessary paths for login, logout, and error handling.\\n\\n### 3. Configure the Identity Provider\\nYou can use Choreo's built-in identity provider or an external one that supports OIDC/OAuth2.0.\\n\\n- **For Choreo Built-in Identity Provider**:\\n  - In the Choreo Console, go to your component.\\n  - Click on **Settings** > **Authentication Keys** and select **Choreo Built-In Identity Provider**.\\n  - Generate the secret key.\\n\\n- **For External Identity Provider (like Asgardeo)**:\\n  - Create an OIDC/OAuth2.0 application in your identity provider.\\n  - Link this application to your Choreo component by pasting the Client ID and Client Secret in the Authentication Keys settings.\\n\\n### 4. Invoke APIs\\nYou can invoke APIs using the relative path `/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>`, and Choreo will automatically handle the access tokens if managed authentication is enabled.\\n\\n### 5. Handle Session Expiry\\nTo manage session expiry, monitor the `401 Unauthorized` response to trigger a re-login:\\n\\n```javascript\\nexport const performGet = async (url) => {\\n  try {\\n    return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>');\\n  } catch (error) {\\n    if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {\\n      window.location.href = \"/auth/login\";\\n    } else {\\n      throw error;\\n    }\\n  }\\n};\\n```\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n- Managed authentication is available for web applications created with **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js** buildpacks.\\n- Ensure to use modern browsers that support the 'SAMESITE' cookie attribute to prevent CSRF attacks.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I manage authentication with personal access tokens in Choreo CLI?", "output": "To manage authentication using personal access tokens in Choreo CLI, follow these general steps:\\n\\n1. **Obtain a Personal Access Token (PAT)**: First, you need to obtain a personal access token from your GitLab self-managed server. This token will grant Choreo the necessary permissions to perform actions on your behalf within the repository. The required permissions include full read/write access to the API and the repository.\\n\\n2. **Use the PAT in Choreo CLI**: Once you have your PAT, you can use it to authenticate your requests in the Choreo CLI. When making API calls, include the PAT in the `Authorization` header as follows:\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>\" -X GET \"https://your-api-endpoint\"\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Manage Access Tokens**: You can manage access tokens by generating, refreshing, or revoking them as necessary. For example, if you need to revoke a token, keep in mind that JWT access tokens are self-validating, which makes revocation challenging. It is recommended to use short-lived tokens and refresh them regularly to enhance security.\\n\\nFor detailed steps on how to authorize a self-managed GitLab with Choreo, you can refer to the documentation here: [Authorize self-managed GitLab with Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/#authorize-self-managed-gitlab-with-choreo).\\n\\nIf you need more information about managing access tokens, you can check the following link: [Manage Applications - Revoke access tokens](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#revoke-access-tokens). \\n\\nThis approach will help you effectively manage authentication using personal access tokens in Choreo CLI."}

You can download it from the [Ballerina website](https://ballerina.io/downloads/swan-lake-release-notes/swan-lake-2201.5.5).\\n2. **Access Token Configuration**: Open the `~/.ballerina/settings.toml` file and configure an access token for Ballerina Central. You can generate a token from [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/dashboard?tab=token) and copy the `Settings.toml` file to your local `~/.ballerina` directory or set it as an environment variable.\\n\\n### Step 1: Initialize a Ballerina Project\\nUse the Choreo template to create a mediation policy project:\\n```bash\\nbal new -t choreo/mediation.template:1.0.0 <policy-name>\\n```\\nExample:\\n```bash\\nbal new -t choreo/mediation.template:1.0.0 validateHeader\\n```\\nThis will create a Ballerina project with the necessary configurations.\\n\\n### Step 2: Implement the Policy\\nOpen the `policy.bal` file in your project and implement your policy. For instance, if you want to validate an incoming request header, you can modify the request and response stubs accordingly. \\n\\n#### Sample Implementation:\\n**Request Flow**:\\n```ballerina\\n@mediation:RequestFlow\\npublic function validateRequestHeader(mediation:Context ctx, http:Request req, string headerName, string headerValue) returns http:Response|false|error|() {\\n    string|http:HeaderNotFoundError header = req.getHeader(headerName);\\n    if (header is http:HeaderNotFoundError) {\\n        string message = string `Header ${headerName} is not found`;\\n        log:printError(message);\\n        return generateResponse(message, http:STATUS_BAD_REQUEST);\\n    }\\n    if (header != headerValue) {\\n        string validationFailedMessage = string `Header validation failed. Expected ${headerValue} but found ${header}`;\\n        log:printError(validationFailedMessage);\\n        return generateResponse(validationFailedMessage, http:STATUS_BAD_REQUEST);\\n    }\\n    log:printInfo(\"Header validation successful\");\\n    return ();\\n}\\n\\nfunction generateResponse(string message, int statusCode) returns http:Response {\\n    http:Response response = new();\\n    response.setTextPayload(message);\\n    response.statusCode = statusCode;\\n    return response;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Response Flow**:\\n```ballerina\\n@mediation:ResponseFlow\\npublic function validateResponseHeader(mediation:Context ctx, http:Request req, http:Response res, string headerName, string headerValue) returns http:Response|false|error|() {\\n    string|http:HeaderNotFoundError header = res.getHeader(headerName);\\n    if (header is http:HeaderNotFoundError) {\\n        string message = string `Header ${headerName} is not found`;\\n        log:printError(message);\\n        return ();\\n    }\\n    if (header != headerValue) {\\n        string validationFailedMessage = string `Header validation failed. Expected ${headerValue} but found ${header}`;\\n        log:printError(validationFailedMessage);\\n        return ();\\n    }\\n    return ();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Publish the Policy\\nOnce your policy is implemented, you need to publish it to Ballerina Central:\\n1. Package the policy:\\n   ```bash\\n   bal pack\\n   ```\\n2. Publish the package:\\n   ```bash\\n   bal push\\n   ```\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n- Organize your source code within the default module and avoid adding additional modules.\\n- Familiarize yourself with different return types of policy flows (like `http:Response`, `false`, `error`, and `()`).\\n\\nFor detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on how to [implement an API policy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-policies/#implement-an-api-policy) in Choreo."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How can I troubleshoot issues related to scale-to-zero in Choreo?", "output": "To troubleshoot issues related to the scale-to-zero feature in Choreo, you can follow these guidelines to identify and resolve common problems:\\n\\n### 1. **503 Status Code on First Request**\\n   - It's common to encounter a 503 status code on the first request after deploying a component with scale-to-zero enabled. This usually happens because the readiness probe has default values that may not align with your application's needs. \\n   - **Solution**: Adjust the readiness probe settings in the **DevOps** \u2192 **Health Checks** view to better fit your application.\\n\\n### 2. **Port Limitations**\\n   - Ensure that your HTTP service runs on the specified ports for scale-to-zero to work. The supported ports are:\\n     - 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 7070 to 7079, 8080 to 8089, and 9090 to 9099, or 8290.\\n   - **Solution**: If your service is running on a different port, it will not automatically scale to zero. You may need to change the port or adjust your service configuration.\\n\\n### 3. **Scheduled Tasks and Component Connections**\\n   - Scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a service on a project scope if scale-to-zero is enabled. This may result in errors like `Host not found, not forwarding request`.\\n   - **Solution**: Set the task-type component to HPA mode (if on a paid plan) or to no scaling (if on the Developer plan).\\n\\n### 4. **Service Startup Time**\\n   - After enabling scale-to-zero, the service should start within 60 seconds. If it does not, the gateway will timeout the request.\\n   - **Solution**: Monitor the startup time and ensure that it is within the expected limit. If it consistently exceeds this duration, consider optimizing your service's startup process.\\n\\n### 5. **Component Deployment and Environment Configuration**\\n   - Make sure that your component is deployed and ready to receive traffic before expecting it to scale to zero.\\n   - **Solution**: Check the deployment status in the **Component Listing** pane and ensure that your settings are correctly applied in the **DevOps** \u2192 **Scaling** view.\\n\\nBy following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to identify and resolve common issues related to the scale-to-zero feature in Choreo.\\n\\nFor more detailed guidance, please refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#troubleshooting)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I manage different versions of my APIs in Choreo?", "output": "In Choreo, users can manage different versions of APIs effectively through the subscription process and by utilizing the Developer Portal. Here\u2019s how it works:\\n\\n1. **Subscription to APIs**: When you subscribe to an API, your subscription automatically covers all minor versions within that API's major version. This means that if a new minor version of an API is published, the invocation URL for the major version will route to the latest minor version. This ensures that existing client applications continue to function without any disruption while still benefiting from updates in the newer minor version.\\n\\n2. **Viewing API Versions**: In the Choreo Developer Portal, APIs are listed by their major versions. You can view the subscribed versions of an API along with details such as the application name and the creation date. This allows you to keep track of which versions of the API your applications are using.\\n\\n3. **Lifecycle Management**: APIs in Choreo go through various lifecycle states \u2014 CREATED, PRE-RELEASED, PUBLISHED, BLOCKED, DEPRECATED, and RETIRED. When a new version is released, the previous version can be marked as DEPRECATED, allowing existing subscribers to continue using it while new subscriptions are disabled. Eventually, when the old version is no longer in use, it can be RETIRED.\\n\\n4. **Best Practices**: It is recommended to always use the latest version of an API to ensure compatibility with the most recent updates. You can copy the endpoint from the API overview page in the Developer Portal and integrate it into your client application.\\n\\nFor more detailed steps on how to manage API subscriptions and view available API versions, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Create a Subscription](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/create-a-subscription/)\\n- [Discover APIs](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/consume-an-api-hosted-in-choreo/#discover-apis)\\n- [API Lifecycle Management](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/lifecycle-management/#api-lifecycle-states)\\n\\nThis structured approach allows for effective management of API versions and ensures that applications can adapt to changes seamlessly."}

The minimum ensures that there is always a baseline level of availability, while the maximum prevents over-provisioning, allowing for controlled resource management.\\n\\n### 2. Performance Optimization\\n- **High Availability**: By automatically adjusting the number of replicas, Choreo ensures that your application can handle varying loads efficiently. This leads to improved response times and reduced latency, as there are always enough instances available to handle incoming requests.\\n- **Scale-to-Zero Feature**: For HTTP applications, Choreo provides a scale-to-zero capability, which allows components to scale down to zero replicas when not in use, thus optimizing resource allocation. When traffic resumes, the service scales back up to handle requests, ensuring optimal performance without wasting resources during idle times.\\n\\n### 3. Cost Efficiency\\n- **Reduced Infrastructure Costs**: By scaling down to zero during periods of low demand, Choreo helps to significantly reduce infrastructure costs, particularly in lower environments. This is advantageous for organizations looking to minimize operational expenses while maintaining the flexibility to scale resources when needed.\\n- **Controlled Scaling**: The ability to set both minimum and maximum replicas allows organizations to control costs by preventing over-allocation of resources, ensuring that users only pay for what they need.\\n\\nIn summary, autoscaling component replicas in Choreo enhances resource management and performance while also promoting cost efficiency, making it a valuable feature for managing deployed components effectively.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [Autoscale Component Replicas](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-component-replicas/) and [Autoscale Components with Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/)."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is scale-to-zero and how does it work in Choreo?", "output": "**Scale-to-Zero in Choreo**\\n\\nScale-to-zero is a feature in Choreo that allows HTTP applications to automatically scale down to zero when they are idle, helping to reduce infrastructure costs. This capability is particularly beneficial in lower environments, but it can also be utilized in production settings depending on the application's behavior.\\n\\n### How Scale-to-Zero Works\\n\\n1. **Automatic Scaling**: When your application is inactive (i.e., not receiving any HTTP traffic), it will automatically scale down to zero after a default idle time of approximately 5 minutes.\\n2. **Request Handling**: If an incoming HTTP request is made while the application is scaled to zero, an intermediary proxy service intercepts the request:\\n   - The proxy holds the request in a queue until the application scales up.\\n   - Once the application is active, the proxy forwards the queued requests to it.\\n3. **Scaling Up**: Upon receiving a new request, the deployment scales up to one replica to handle the workload. If there is a surge in traffic, Choreo can further scale the application by adding replicas, up to the maximum limit specified by the user.\\n4. **Pending Requests**: If the number of queued requests exceeds a predefined threshold (default is 100), Choreo will automatically add new replicas to manage the load effectively.\\n\\n### Considerations and Limitations\\n\\n- **Supported Components**: Scale-to-zero is applicable only to HTTP services and web applications. It does not support TCP and HTTPS services.\\n- **Specified Ports**: To utilize the scale-to-zero feature, your HTTP service must run on specific ports (e.g., 5000, 6000, 7000, etc.). Services running on other ports will not automatically scale to zero.\\n- **Scheduled Tasks**: Scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to services under a project scope if scale-to-zero is enabled, resulting in an error when attempted.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting\\n\\nIn cases where you experience a 503 status code on the first request after a long period of inactivity, it may be necessary to adjust the readiness probe settings to better align with your application's requirements.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation here: [Autoscale Components with Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/)"}
{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What are the limitations of scale-to-zero in Choreo?", "output": "The scale-to-zero feature in Choreo allows HTTP applications to automatically scale down to zero when idle, significantly reducing infrastructure costs, especially in lower environments. However, there are several limitations to this feature:\\n\\n1. **Supported Component Types**: The scale-to-zero feature currently only supports web applications and HTTP services. It does not support TCP and HTTPS services for scaling to zero.\\n\\n2. **Port Restrictions**: For an HTTP service to utilize the scale-to-zero feature, it must be running on one of the following specified ports:\\n   - 5000\\n   - 6000\\n   - 7000\\n   - 8000\\n   - 9000\\n   - 7070 to 7079\\n   - 8080 to 8089\\n   - 9090 to 9099\\n   - 8290\\n   \\n   If an endpoint in your component is running on any other port, it will not automatically scale to zero during deployment or promotion. Attempts to enable the \u201cscale-to-zero\u201d option in the DevOps \u2192 Scaling view will also fail.\\n\\n3. **Scheduled Tasks and Manual Triggers**: Scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a service on a project scope if scale-to-zero is enabled. If such a connection is attempted, the following error will occur:\\n   ```\\n   Host not found, not forwarding request.\\n   ```\\n   To enable a task-type component to invoke a project-level service, you must set it to HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) mode if you are on a paid plan, or to no scaling if you are using the Developer plan.\\n\\nThese limitations are important to consider when planning to use the scale-to-zero functionality for your services.\\n\\nFor more details, you can refer to the [Choreo documentation on scale-to-zero limitations](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#limitations)."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I troubleshoot issues with scale-to-zero?", "output": "To troubleshoot issues related to the scale-to-zero feature in Choreo, here are some common problems and their solutions:\\n\\n### Common Issues and Solutions\\n\\n1. **503 Status Code on First Request**:\\n   - **Problem**: You might observe that the first request to your application responds with a 503 status code after scaling to zero.\\n   - **Solution**: Fine-tune the readiness probe settings to better match your application's needs. This can be done in the **DevOps** \u2192 **Health Checks** view.\\n\\n2. **HTTP Service Port Restrictions**:\\n   - **Problem**: Your HTTP service must run on specific ports to enable scale-to-zero. If your service is on an unsupported port, it will not scale to zero.\\n   - **Solution**: Ensure that your HTTP service is running on one of the allowed ports (e.g., 5000, 6000, 7000, etc.).\\n\\n3. **Scheduled Tasks and Manual Invocations**:\\n   - **Problem**: If scale-to-zero is enabled, scheduled tasks and manually triggered components cannot connect to a service at the project scope, leading to errors like `Host not found, not forwarding request.` \\n   - **Solution**: Set the task-type components to HPA mode if you are on a paid plan or to no scaling if you are on the Developer plan.\\n\\n4. **Initial Delay for Inactive Applications**:\\n   - **Problem**: After a period of inactivity (default idle time is 5 minutes), your application scales down to zero, which can lead to delays when it scales back up upon receiving requests.\\n   - **Solution**: Be aware that the first request after inactivity will take longer to process. If your application is part of a service chain, this delay may be extended further. \\n\\n5. **Request Queueing and Scaling Thresholds**:\\n   - **Problem**: If there are too many queued requests, it may affect how quickly your application can scale up.\\n   - **Solution**: Adjust the 'Target Pending Requests' threshold in the user interface to manage how your application handles incoming requests during scaling.\\n\\nBy addressing these common issues, you can effectively troubleshoot and optimize the scale-to-zero functionality in your Choreo environment.\\n\\nFor more details, you can refer to the documentation on [Autoscale Components with Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#troubleshooting)."}

Here are some key recommendations:\\n\\n1. **Follow Tailscale's Best Practices**: Before deploying the Tailscale proxy in production environments, adhere to the Tailscale [security best practices](https://tailscale.com/kb/1196/security-hardening) and [production best practices](https://tailscale.com/kb/1300/production-best-practices).\\n\\n2. **Health Checks**: Configure health checks for your Tailscale proxy. Since it acts as a forward proxy, using one of the open ports of the TCP forwarder as a health endpoint is advisable. For more information on setting up health probes in Choreo, refer to the documentation on [Set up health checks](./set-up-health-checks).\\n\\n3. **Use Tailscale ACLs**: Implement Tailscale Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage permissions for users and devices on your Tailnet. This helps in controlling who can access what within your network.\\n\\n4. **Disable Scale-to-Zero**: It is recommended to disable the Scale-to-Zero feature for the Tailscale proxy. This component should always be running to maintain consistent connections with the Tailscale VPN mesh, as enabling Scale-to-Zero could lead to service downtime.\\n\\n5. **Run Multiple Replicas**: To enhance high availability and resiliency, run multiple replicas of the Tailscale proxy using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA). This ensures that your service remains operational even if one instance fails.\\n\\n6. **Secure Connection**: Choreo blocks incoming connections from other nodes in your Tailnet to the Tailscale proxy. This prevents unauthorized access to your project's namespace in the Choreo cloud data plane.\\n\\nBy following these best practices, you can mitigate potential security risks and maintain a reliable connection through Tailscale in your Choreo projects.\\n\\nFor further details, you can refer to the relevant sections in the documentation: \\n- [Security best practices](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-vpns-on-the-choreo-cloud-data-plane/#security-best-practices)\\n- [Best practices](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-vpns-on-the-choreo-cloud-data-plane/#best-practices)"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is a context path and why is it needed for APIs when configuring a custom URL?", "output": "A **context path** in API configuration is a specific segment of the URL that is used for routing purposes. It defines a base path that precedes the endpoint for the API, allowing multiple services or endpoints to coexist under the same domain without conflict. The context path is particularly important when setting up a custom URL because it helps to uniquely identify the API's entry point within the broader context of the application or service.\\n\\nWhen configuring a custom URL for your component in Choreo, you need to specify an appropriate context path in the **Path** field. This context path serves as a namespace for your API, helping to organize and manage the various endpoints that may be exposed by your service. For example, if you have multiple APIs under the same domain, each can have a different context path, thus avoiding any potential URL conflicts.\\n\\nHere are some key points regarding the context path and its importance:\\n\\n- **Routing**: The context path directs incoming requests to the appropriate service or endpoint, facilitating proper routing within your application.\\n- **Organization**: It helps in organizing APIs logically, especially when multiple APIs are available under the same domain.\\n- **Custom URL Configuration**: When you set up a custom URL, the context path must be provided to ensure that the API can be accessed correctly.\\n\\nTo configure a custom URL for your component, follow the steps in the Choreo Console, where you specify the context path as part of the URL settings.\\n\\nFor more detailed guidance, refer to the documentation on configuring a custom URL for components: [Configure a Custom URL for a Component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#configure-a-custom-url-for-a-component)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What are Roles, Groups, and Mapping levels and how are they used to control access in Choreo?", "output": "In Choreo, access control is managed through the concepts of **Roles**, **Groups**, and **Mapping levels**. Here's a detailed explanation of each concept and how they work together to control access:\\n\\n### Roles\\nA **Role** in Choreo is a collection of permissions. Choreo provides a predefined set of roles, each associated with specific permissions that determine what actions a user can perform. For example, roles might include permissions for publishing APIs, managing projects, or administering the organization.\\n\\n### Groups\\nA **Group** is a collection of users. To grant access to users, a group must have one or more roles assigned to it. When users are added to a group, they inherit the permissions associated with that group's roles. For instance, if a group is assigned the Developer role, all users in that group will have developer access.\\n\\n### Mapping Levels\\n**Mapping levels** define the scope at which roles can be assigned to groups. Choreo recognizes two primary mapping levels:\\n\\n1. **Organization Level**: Roles assigned at this level provide permissions across all resources within the organization. For example, if a user has the permission to edit projects at the organization level, they can edit any project within that organization.\\n\\n2. **Project Level**: Roles assigned at this level restrict permissions to specific projects. For instance, if a user is granted edit permissions only for a specific project, they cannot edit any other projects within the organization.\\n\\n### Access Control Mechanism\\nThe authorization process in Choreo involves assigning a role to a group at a specified mapping level. The level at which the role is assigned determines the extent of permissions granted to the users. \\n\\n- **Organization-level permissions** take precedence over project-level permissions. This means that if a user has permissions at both levels, the organization-level permissions will apply.\\n\\n### Important Considerations\\n- It is advised to avoid assigning multiple roles to a single user across different projects or mapping levels, as this can inadvertently grant users broader access than intended.\\n- Properly managing roles and groups ensures that users have access only to the resources they need, following the principle of least privilege.\\n\\nBy understanding these concepts, administrators can effectively manage user permissions and ensure secure access control within the Choreo Console.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on this topic, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is the difference between Organization and Project mapping levels in Choreo?", "output": "In Choreo, the distinction between Organization and Project mapping levels is crucial for managing access control effectively. Here's a detailed explanation of both levels:\\n\\n### Organization Mapping Level\\n- **Scope**: At the organization mapping level, roles are assigned to user groups across all projects within the organization. This means that any permissions granted to a role at this level apply universally to all projects under that organization.\\n- **Example**: If a user is granted the `edit_project` permission at the organization level, that user can edit all projects within the organization. This is beneficial for administrators who want to manage access at a broader scale.\\n\\n### Project Mapping Level\\n- **Scope**: At the project mapping level, roles are assigned to user groups within a specific project. Permissions granted at this level are limited to that particular project only.\\n- **Example**: If a user is granted the `edit_project` permission at the project level, that user can only edit the designated project and not any other projects in the organization. This allows for more granular control over who can access and modify specific projects.\\n\\n### Key Differences\\n- **Permission Scope**: Organization-level permissions apply to all projects, while project-level permissions are restricted to a single project.\\n- **Use Cases**: Organization-level is useful for overarching roles that need to be consistent across all projects, whereas project-level is ideal for roles that require specificity and limited access only to certain projects.\\n\\n### Important Considerations\\n- Organization-level permissions take precedence over project-level permissions. Thus, if a user has both organization-level and project-level permissions, the organization-level permissions will apply.\\n- It is recommended to avoid assigning multiple roles to a single user across different projects or levels to prevent unintended access.\\n\\nFor further details, you can refer to the documentation on [Control Access in the Choreo Console](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/)."}

This is crucial for managing who can modify or deploy components within the project, ensuring that only authorized personnel have the necessary permissions.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Details\\n\\n1. **Create a Project**:\\n   - You start by creating a project where development activities will take place. This step involves specifying a unique project name and description, which helps in identifying the project within the organization.\\n\\n2. **Create a New Group**:\\n   - After setting up the project, the next step is to create a group specifically for users who will have development access. In this scenario, the group is named \"Engineering Project Developer.\" This helps in organizing users based on their roles and responsibilities.\\n\\n3. **Assign Roles to the Group**:\\n   - Once the group is created, you assign the \"Developer\" role to it. This role grants the designated users the necessary permissions to perform development tasks within the project. The mapping level indicates that this access is limited to the specific project, preventing any unintended organization-wide access.\\n\\n4. **Add Users to the Group**:\\n   - Finally, users can be added to the newly created group. There are two methods for adding users:\\n     - Inviting new users by specifying their email addresses.\\n     - Adding existing users by searching for them in the system and assigning them to the group.\\n   - It is important to ensure that users are removed from other groups to avoid granting broader access than intended.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you effectively manage who can engage in development activities within the \"Engineering Project,\" ensuring that only authorized users have the necessary access.\\n\\nFor a detailed guide, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/control-access-in-the-choreo-console/#sample-scenario)."}

This allows the plan to handle spikes in usage without immediately throttling requests.\\n\\n5. **Finalizing the Plan**:\\n   - Once all settings are configured, click on **Create** to finalize the subscription plan.\\n\\nAfter creating the subscription plans, users with the API publisher role can assign these plans to APIs, allowing API consumers to select the appropriate plan based on their requirements.\\n\\nFor further details, you can refer to the [Create API Subscription Plans documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/create-api-subscription-plans/) for extensive guidance."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is API rate limiting and why is it important?", "output": "API rate limiting is a technique used in API management to control the number of requests that a client can make to an API within a specific time frame. This is crucial for several reasons:\\n\\n1. **Preventing System Overload**: By limiting the rate of requests, you can avoid overwhelming the server, which can lead to performance degradation or outages.\\n\\n2. **Enhancing API Performance**: Rate limiting ensures that all users have fair access to the API, maintaining responsiveness and availability.\\n\\n3. **Protection Against Malicious Attacks**: It helps mitigate risks from abusive behaviors, such as denial-of-service attacks, by restricting the number of requests from a single source.\\n\\nIn Choreo, there are two main types of rate limiting:\\n\\n- **API-level Rate Limiting**: This applies the allocated request count across all operations in the API, ensuring a uniform limit.\\n\\n- **Operation-level Rate Limiting**: This allows different rate limits for individual operations within the API, which is useful for critical operations that may require additional protection.\\n\\nWhen rate limiting is enabled, the API can return specific response headers that provide information about the limits, such as:\\n\\n| **Header Name**            | **Description**                                                  |\\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| `x-ratelimit-limit`       | The request count allocated for the specified time unit.        |\\n| `x-ratelimit-reset`       | Time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit.      |\\n| `x-ratelimit-remaining`   | Remaining request count for the specified time unit.            |\\n| `x-ratelimit-enforced`    | Indicates when the allocated request count has been exceeded.   |\\n\\nTo learn more about enabling rate limiting for your APIs and the different options available, you can refer to the detailed documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/)."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is API-level rate limiting?", "output": "API-level rate limiting in Choreo is a mechanism that applies a specified number of allowed requests over a defined time unit across all operations within an API.

Moreover, it serves as a protective measure against potential malicious attacks.\\n\\n### How API-level Rate Limiting Works:\\n- **Request Count**: The total number of requests allowed within a specified time frame is set. For example, you might configure an API to allow 100 requests per minute.\\n- **Impact on Operations**: This limit applies uniformly across all operations of the API, meaning every endpoint will share the same rate limit.\\n- **Response Headers**: When rate limiting is enabled, certain response headers provide information about the rate limit status:\\n  - `x-ratelimit-limit`: Indicates the maximum request count allocated for the specified time unit.\\n  - `x-ratelimit-reset`: Shows the time remaining until the next rate-limiting period starts.\\n  - `x-ratelimit-remaining`: Denotes how many requests are left for the specified time unit.\\n  - `x-ratelimit-enforced`: This header appears when the allocated request count has been exceeded.\\n\\nThis rate-limiting configuration helps maintain the performance and reliability of the API by controlling the traffic it handles.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on [API Rate Limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/#api-level-rate-limiting)."}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is mutual TLS and how does it secure communication between components in Choreo?", "output": "Mutual TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a protocol that enhances security in communication by ensuring that both the client and server authenticate each other's identities using digital certificates. This mutual authentication establishes a trust relationship between the two endpoints, which is critical in scenarios where sensitive data is being transmitted.\\n\\n### Role of Mutual TLS in Securing Communication Between Choreo Components\\n\\n1. **Authentication**: In mutual TLS, both the client and server present their certificates to verify their identities. This two-way authentication significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access and identity spoofing.\\n\\n2. **Data Encryption**: Once authentication is successful, mutual TLS encrypts the data exchanged between the client and server. This encryption ensures that even if the data is intercepted, it cannot be read or tampered with by unauthorized entities.\\n\\n3. **Component Communication**: Within Choreo, mutual TLS can be used to secure connections between different components of a project. By implementing mutual TLS, you can ensure that only authorized components can communicate with each other, thus protecting the integrity and confidentiality of your application\u2019s data.\\n\\n4. **Configuration**: To configure mutual TLS in Choreo, you would typically need to upload the server certificate to Choreo and configure the client certificate in the backend to establish secure connectivity. This involves:\\n   - Uploading the backend server's public certificate to Choreo.\\n   - Adding Choreo's client certificate as a trusted certificate in the backend service.\\n\\n   The setup ensures that the Choreo Gateway and your backend service can securely communicate using mutual TLS.\\n\\n### Summary\\nIn summary, mutual TLS plays a vital role in enhancing the security of communications between Choreo components by providing robust authentication and data encryption, ensuring that only legitimate services can interact with each other.\\n\\nFor more detailed guidance on configuring mutual TLS in Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Configure Mutual TLS Between Components](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/)\\n- [Secure Communication Between the Choreo Gateway and Your Backend with Mutual TLS](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-communication-between-the-choreo-gateway-and-your-backend-with-mutual-tls/)"}

Generate a Root Certificate\\n- The root certificate acts as a trusted certificate, verifying the authenticity of other certificates during the mutual TLS handshake process. You can generate a root certificate using a tool like OpenSSL. This certificate is used to sign both the client and server certificates.\\n\\n### 2. Generate a Client Certificate\\n- The client certificate contains the client's identity for authentication. The common name (CN) in this certificate identifies the client. Ensure that the client certificate is signed by the root certificate.\\n\\n### 3. Generate a Server Certificate\\n- The server certificate is used by clients to verify the trustworthiness of the server and establish a secure connection. Like the client certificate, the server certificate must also be signed by the root certificate. When generating the server certificate, you need to specify the server's hostname for the Subject Alternative Name (SAN). You can obtain this hostname from the project endpoint on the **Overview** page in Choreo.\\n\\n### Steps to Implement Certificates in Choreo\\nTo generate the client and server certificates directly through Choreo:\\n\\n1. **Access the API Proxy**:\\n   - In the Choreo Console, locate the API proxy for which you want to generate certificates.\\n\\n2. **Enable Mutual SSL**:\\n   - Navigate to **Develop** > **Endpoints** and configure the endpoint. Turn on the **Mutual SSL** toggle.\\n\\n3. **Generate Client Certificate**:\\n   - Click on **Add Client Certificate**, then select **Generate new key pair**. Specify the common name for the certificate pair. You can also provide additional advanced options if needed. Click **Generate** to create the certificate.\\n\\n4. **Download the Certificates**:\\n   - After generation, you can view and download the certificates in PEM format, which can then be added to the API backend server as needed.\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n- Ensure that all certificates are properly signed by the root certificate.\\n- The backend server must have its public certificate extracted in PEM format and configured in Choreo.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Generate certificates to establish mutual TLS](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-mutual-tls-between-components/#generate-certificates-to-establish-mutual-tls)\\n- [Configure mutual TLS to establish secure connectivity](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-communication-between-the-choreo-gateway-and-your-backend-with-mutual-tls/#configure-mutual-tls-to-establish-secure-connectivity)"}

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "What is JWKS and how is it used to validate the JWT in Choreo?", "output": "In Choreo, JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) is used to validate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) by providing the public keys necessary for signature verification. The process of using JWKS for validating JWTs involves several steps:\\n\\n### Process of Validating JWTs with JWKS\\n\\n1. **JWT Issuance**: A JWT is issued by an identity provider (IdP) and signed using a private key. This token includes claims that provide information about the user and the authentication context.\\n\\n2. **Obtaining the JWKS**:\\n   - Choreo provides a JWKS endpoint where the public keys can be retrieved. The endpoints vary based on the region:\\n     - For US East: `https://gateway.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/.wellknown/jwks`\\n     - For EU North: `https://gateway.e1-eu-north-azure.choreoapis.dev/.wellknown/jwks`\\n   - For private data planes, the format is: `https://<PDP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN>/.wellknown/jwks`, where `<PDP_GATEWAY_DOMAIN>` is replaced with your specific domain.\\n\\n3. **Key Identification**: Each key in the JWKS has a `kid` (key identifier) that is used to identify the correct key for validating the JWT's signature. The `kid` from the JWT header must match the `kid` in the JWKS response.\\n\\n4. **Validation**:\\n   - The recipient of the JWT retrieves the JWKS and locates the key with the matching `kid`.\\n   - The JWT's signature is then validated using the corresponding public key, ensuring that the token has not been tampered with and is indeed issued by a trusted authority.\\n\\n### Sample JWKS Response Structure\\nA typical JWKS response will look like this:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"keys\": [\\n    {\\n      \"kty\": \"RSA\",\\n      \"e\": \"AQAB\",\\n      \"use\": \"sig\",\\n      \"kid\": \"your-key-id\",\\n      \"alg\": \"RS256\",\\n      \"n\": \"your-modulus\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### JWKS Properties Description\\n| **Property** | **Description** |\\n|--------------|------------------|\\n| `kty`        | The type of key; in Choreo, only RSA is supported. |\\n| `e`          | The exponent value of the public key. |\\n| `use`        | Indicates the purpose of the key, such as signing or encryption. |\\n| `kid`        | Key identifier for matching with the JWT. |\\n| `alg`        | The algorithm used with the key (e.g., RS256). |\\n| `n`          | The modulus value of the public key. |\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nUsing JWKS for JWT validation helps in managing key rotation and ensures that applications can dynamically obtain the public keys needed for validating JWTs without hard-coding them.

The default is `/`.\\n   - **Error Path**: Optionally, you can specify a custom error page for authentication errors.\\n\\n### Step 2: Implement Sign-In Functionality\\n\\nTo allow users to sign in, create a button in your web application that redirects users to Choreo's login URL. Use the following code snippet:\\n\\n```javascript\\n<button onClick={() => {window.location.href=\"/auth/login\"}}>Login</button>\\n```\\n\\nWhen the user clicks this button, they will be redirected to the identity provider to authenticate.

You can retrieve this cookie using a library like `js-cookie`:\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport Cookies from 'js-cookie';\\n\\n// Read userinfo cookie value\\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');\\n\\n// Decode the value\\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));\\n\\n// Store the value in a preferred browser-based storage if needed\\n\\n// Clear the cookie\\nCookies.remove('userinfo', { path: <post-login-path> });\\n```\\n\\n> **Note:** The `userinfo` cookie has a short lifespan of 2 minutes, so you should handle it accordingly.\\n\\n#### Option 2: Retrieve User Information via the `/auth/userinfo` Endpoint\\nAlternatively, you can query user information by making a GET request to the `/auth/userinfo` endpoint:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');\\nif (response.ok) {\\n    const userInfo = await response.json();\\n    // Handle userInfo as needed\\n} else {\\n    // Handle error\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf the user is signed in, the server will return a `200 OK` response with user information in JSON format.

Use the following format to call your API:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>');\\n```\\n\\nHere, `<api-suffix>` should correspond to the API endpoint you want to access. For example, if your API URL is `https://example.com/api/v1/resource`, then your `<api-suffix>` would be `/api/v1/resource`.\\n\\n**Note:** If managed authentication is enabled, you do not need to manually attach an access token; Choreo automatically handles this by accepting the cookies set during authentication.\\n\\n### 4.

{"instruction": "Answer the following question about choreo", "input": "How do I handle session expiry in a web application using Choreo's managed authentication?", "output": "To manage session expiry within a web application using Choreo's managed authentication services, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Session Expiry Time Configuration**: When you set up managed authentication for your web application, you can specify the session expiry time in minutes. It's recommended that this value matches the refresh token expiry time of the OIDC application in your identity provider. The default session expiry time is set to 10080 minutes (7 days), but you can adjust this based on your application's requirements.\\n\\n2. **Handling Session Expiry in Code**: To handle session expiry programmatically, you can implement re-login logic upon receiving a `401 Unauthorized` response from a Choreo API, which indicates that the session may have expired. You can encapsulate your API requests with a function that checks for this status code and redirects users to the login page if needed. Here\u2019s a sample code snippet to demonstrate this:\\n\\n   ```javascript\\n   export const performGet = async (url) => {\\n       try {\\n           // API call\\n           return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>');\\n       } catch (error) {\\n           if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) {\\n               // Re-login\\n               window.location.href = \"/auth/login\";\\n           } else {\\n               throw error;\\n           }\\n       }\\n   };\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Logout Functionality**: Implement a logout mechanism that clears session cookies and redirects the user to the OIDC logout endpoint. This ensures that the session is properly terminated when the user chooses to log out:\\n\\n   ```javascript\\n   <button onClick={async () => {\\n       window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`;\\n   }}>Logout</button>\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Session Management Best Practices**: It's advisable to keep JWT access tokens short-lived (e.g., no more than 15 minutes) to minimize security risks associated with stolen tokens.
