In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\\n5. Click **Save**. \\n\\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\\n\\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\\n\\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\\n\\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\\\"\\\"cat\\\"\\\", \\\"\\\"/tmp/healthy\\\"\\\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\\n\\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.\",\n",

    "\"To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs.

    "\"To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1.

You can create a config file mount via the Configurations pane on the Deploy page in the Choreo Console.\",\n",
    "\"To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

    "\"To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.\",\n",
    "\"Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon. Expand the Rate Limiting section under Manage. Select a Rate Limiting Level and click Apply. Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count.

         "The \"Module not found error\" typically occurs when your application cannot locate or access the necessary libraries or files that it needs to run properly. This issue can occur both at the time of deployment and while running the deployed application. Here are some strategies you can use to resolve this error:\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot and Resolve Module Not Found Errors During Deployment:\n\n1. **Verify File Paths**: Ensure that all required files (such as configurations, scripts, etc.) are stored in the correct directory. Sometimes, relative paths may cause the module to be inaccessible.\n\n   Example: If your `main.py` is located in `/my/project/main.py`, make sure that any other files or directories are accessible through the same path.\n\n2. **Check Libraries**: Confirm that all dependencies are included correctly. Missing or incorrectly referenced third-party libraries can cause a `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n\n   - Make sure your Dockerfile contains commands to install any necessary dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` (if you're using a Python project). For example:\n     ```bash\ncp requirements.txt .\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n3. **Dockerfile Structure**: If you are using a Dockerfile, ensure it follows best practices:\n\n   - Use an explicit `WORKDIR` to avoid potential confusion with environment variables.\n   - Ensure the command section is clean and separates from the `COPY` section for better readability and maintainability.\n   \n   ```Dockerfile\nFROM python:3.7\nRUN cp requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt\nCOPY . /app\nWORKDIR /app\nENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\n# Add other commands here if needed\n``` \n\n4. **Container Image Build Failure**: If there are issues during container image build, the command will return with a non-zero exit status, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. To troubleshoot:\n\n   - Clean the cache before building (`docker build -f <path-to-Dockerfile> -t <image-name>:<tag> -ci .`).\n   - Check if there are any permission errors or file corruption during the build process.\n\n5. **CI/CD Process**: Ensure your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes are configured correctly:\n\n   - Check if your component has set up a proper build pack. The build pack handles compiling your code, packaging it into a container image, and pushing it to your preferred cloud environment.\n   - Verify that all environment variables are properly defined and assigned to their respective components.\n\n6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Use logging and monitoring tools within your Choreo Console to track any deployment failures and monitor application logs for clues.\n\n### Common Error Messages:\n- **No module named 'some_module'**: This indicates that `some_module.py` cannot be found.\n- **Error reading the manifest file**: This may occur if there are missing or incorrectly formatted dependencies.\n\nFor more detailed troubleshooting, you can refer to the following links in the Choreo documentation:\n- [Builds & Deployments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build-and-deploy)\n- [Build a Container Image From Scratch](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/create-container-image-from-scratch/)",
         "To resolve a **Module not found** error during the deployment of a Python project in Choreo:\n\n1. **Verify Dependencies:**\n - Ensure all required Python modules are in `requirements.txt`\n - Example `requirements.txt`:\n ```plaintext\n flask\n requests\n numpy\n ```\n\n2. **Check File Paths:**\n - Verify that the modules and packages being imported in your Python code have the correct file paths\n\n3. **Rebuild the Component:**\n - Trigger a rebuild after updating `requirements.txt` or file paths. This will ensure that any changes made to the dependencies are included in the new build.\n\n4. **Inspect Logs:**\n - . If the error persists check build logs in Choreo Console UI for detailed error messages. The logs can provide more context on which module is not found and why. \n\n5. **Environment Configuration:**\n - Ensure correct setup of environment variables in Choreo. Sometimes environment variables might be needed for certain modules to work correctly.you can follow these steps:\n\n**Steps to Implement Custom Authentication:**\n\n1. **Add the Connection Configuration:**\n```window.configs = {\napiUrl: '<SERVICE_URL>'",

         "To enhance the security and privacy of your service interactions in Choreo, incorporating authentication mechanisms is essential. Here’s how to configure basic security for REST services, which can then be extended to service-to-service and service-to-user communication.\n\n### Adding Basic Security to a Service\n\n1. **Select Your Component**: In the Choreo Console, locate the component you wish to secure. If you need to generate new credentials, navigate to **Deploy** > **Endpoint Configurations** under the **Set Up** card.\n\n2. **Define Endpoints**: Identify the endpoints that require protection from unauthorized access. Ensure these endpoints include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or TRACE operations, as they may be exposed via standard API proxies.\n\n3. **Configure Endpoint Scopes**: Specify scopes for each endpoint. These are identifiers that describe permissions attached to a resource. This is crucial because you will later apply roles to these scopes during role-based access control. Note that scopes must be defined explicitly, similar to setting tags for a cloud-native database connection. Use appropriate names for scopes to define permissions effectively.\n\n4. **Set Authentication Level**: In the **Deploy** section, select **Basic Security with OAuth** as the authentication level. Configure the necessary options for this method, including selecting your identity provider.\n\n5. **Protect the Endpoint**: To test your secured endpoint, go back to the **Develop** section, click on **Test**, set up test users, and initiate a test request. Upon successful deployment, the Invoke page will display details about the deployed endpoint.\n\n### Extending Authentication\n\nOnce basic authentication is configured, it’s advisable to upgrade your component to an OAuth application if you plan on implementing a full OAuth2.0 flow. This allows you to manage user tokens effectively and handle API subscriptions more rigorously.\n\nFor detailed guidance on configuring an Identity Provider for your service, please refer to the [Choreo documentation on adding basic authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-basic-authentication-for-a-component/#step-3-set-up-the-identity-provider-for-your-component).\n\nBy following these steps, you can secure your service with appropriate measures ensuring safe interaction and enhanced protection against unauthorized access.",

         "Tell me how I can configure a readiness probe?",
         "In Choreo, you can configure various probe types for setting up a readiness probe to manage the health status of your Containerized Application (CCA). Here are some key configurations for the readiness probe:\n\n### Types of Probe\n1. **HTTP GET Request**: \n   - This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A successful response status code is in the range of 200-399.\n   - **Sample script**: `\n      |curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X GET -d {}\n      |--http-port\n      |<port>\n      |<path>`\n   - **Configuration**: [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-an-http-get-request-body)\n\n2. **TCP Connection Probe**:\n   - This probe establishes a TCP connection on the specified port. If it cannot open a socket, it is considered a failure.\n   - **Sample script**: `\n      |[[[probe-tcp-connection-port]]] <port> [\n      |<port>]`\n   - **Configuration**: [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-a-tcp-connection-body)\n\n3. **Execute a Command**: \n   - Executes a given command inside the container. A non-zero return from the command indicates a failure.\n   - **Sample script**: `|[command]`\n   - **Configuration**: [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-an-execute-a-command-body)\n\n4. **File Creation Probe**: \n   - Checks if a specific file exists at a designated location in the container. If not found, it is considered a failure.\n   - **Sample script**: `|-p [/absolute/path/to/file]|[\n       |[-m|--must-exist] |[\n       |[-n|--no-to-file]|[\n       |<directory>]`\n   - **Configuration**: [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-create-a-file-body)\n\n### Steps to Configure Readiness Probes\n1. In the Choreo Console, navigate to **DevOps** and then **Health Checks** under the **Probe Configurations** tab.\n2. Click on **+ Create** to add a new probe configuration.\n3. Choose the type of probe that best suits your needs (HTTP, TCP, Execute Command, or File Creation).\n4. Specify the necessary parameters for the selected probe type, and save your settings.\n\nBy properly configuring the readiness probes, you ensure that your containerized applications receive proper health checks, allowing effective management of application availability in the Choreo environment.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the [Set Up Health Checks documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/).",
         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to configure readiness probes.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

         "How can I secure my web app?",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, there are several steps you can take depending on your specific needs regarding security measures. Here’s a structured approach:\n\n### 1. Implement Authentication\nAuthentication is crucial for securing web applications as it verifies the user’s identity before granting access. The following methods can be used:\n\n   - **Ballerina Built-In Security Token Service**\n     - Set up the Ballerina built-in security token service to manage API keys securely.\n     - Use API key-based security to restrict resource access via project scopes.\n   - **WSO2 Identity Server**\n     - Integrate Choreo components with the WSO2 Identity server for user authentication.\n     - Create users in the identity server, assign roles, and configure an OIDC/OAuth 2.0 authentication flow to protect your resources.\n\n   **Steps to set up Ballerina Built-In Security Token Service**: \n   1. Go to the Choreo console, click on your organization, and select Settings.\n   2. Navigate to the Access Tokens tab, choose to enable Secure Token Storage, and configure the path for the security token file.\n\n   **Steps to integrate WSO2 Identity Server**:\n   1. In the Choreo console, navigate to Settings under Organization.\n   2. Go to the Application Security tab and create a Security Token Handler.\n   3. Assign roles to specific groups through the Identity Provider management under Role Management.\n\n### 2. Implement Authorization\nAuthorization determines who can perform what actions on your web application. You can manage this through roles and permissions.\n\n   - **Define Roles**: Assign roles to users, allowing them to inherit the permissions associated with those roles. For instance, grant admin privileges to selected users.\n   - **Set Permissions**: Assign permissions to roles. This ensures that only designated users can execute specific operations based on their roles.\n\n   **Steps to define Roles and Permissions**: \n   1. Under Organization, go to Settings and then Application Security.\n   2. Click to add new roles and map permissions to these roles.\n\n### 3. Encrypt Data at Rest\nTo protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, it's essential to encrypt it both in transit and at rest.\n\n- **Enable Transport Layer Encryption**: \n  - For API Gateways, ensure that transport layer encryption is enabled across major cloud providers and private data planes.\n  - Implement TLS certificates to secure connections.\n\n- **Encryption at Rest**: \n  - Enable storage encryption for databases like MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Cassandra.\n\n### 4. Monitor and Alert Configuration\nImplementing monitoring and alert configurations can help detect and mitigate threats:\n\n- **Configure Alerts**: \n  - Create alerts to monitor specific metrics like CPU and memory usage thresholds and set notification levels accordingly.\n  - Subscribe to logs to gain insights into any potential breaches.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- Regularly review and update your application’s security measures to stay ahead of emerging threats.\n- Consider using OAuth 2.0 for better authorization practices and API security.\n\nFor further details on configuring authentication, authorization, encryption, and setting up monitoring and alerts in Choreo, please refer to the [Choreo Security Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/authentication-and-authorization-overview/#set-up-basic-authentication-and-secure-api-access).",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

         "What are the steps to secure an API in Choreo?",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can utilize various methods that incorporate built-in security functions or implement JWT-based security tokens. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to secure an API:\n\n### 1. **Use Built-In Security Functions for API Level Authentication**\n   - When creating an API component in Choreo, you have the option to enable security through the following mechanisms:\n     - **Basic Authentication**: For this, set the `username` and `password` fields to define who can access the API. \n     - **Bearer Token Authentication**: Generate a secret key and attach it to the endpoint URL to ensure secure communication.\n   - To configure these settings:\n     1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the REST API you want to secure.\n     2. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Endpoints**.\n     3. Under **Security Overview**, click **Configure New Token** to set up appropriate roles and assign them to specific endpoints.\n\n### 2. **Implement JWT-Based API Security**\n   - To implement JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for securing APIs:\n   - Ensure you have an identity provider (IdP) set up, which can either be built-in or an external IdP. Choreo supports popular IdPs like Asgardeo, Azure AD, AWS Identity and Access Management, GitHub, and OpenID Connect applications.\n   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the project level under **Settings** > **Authentication Keys** and generate the necessary keys to test your JWT implementation.\n   - After deployment, you can invoke the API securely via the generated endpoint URL. \n\n### 3. **Deploying Your Application**\n   - Once you have secured your API component, you need to deploy it to create the necessary keys for testing. This involves:\n   - Creating an API in Developer Portal: \n     1. Click on the API component in the **Component Listing** pane.\n     2. Click **Manage**, then select **Endpoint** and copy the endpoint URL.\n   - Invoking the API with the generated token to test its functionality.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- Always ensure that the application is deployed before attempting to generate the test URL and invoking the API.\n- Properly handle secrets and tokens to maintain security throughout the API lifecycle.\n\nFor further details on this topic, please refer to the official documentation:\n- [Secure API Access](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access/)\n- [Secure an HTTP Service with Managed Identity](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-an-http-service-with-managed-idp/#step-4-generate-the-secrete-token-and-attach-it-to-the-http-service-endpoint) \n- [Configure Endpoints for Your API](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/expose-a-service-as-a-managed-api/#configure-endpoints-for-your-api)",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Below are the general steps for each approach: Securing API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: In the Component Listing pane, click on your API component. Navigate to Manage > Permissions. Click + Add Permission (Scope). Enter the permission value in the Permission List pane and click + Add New. Copy the fully qualified name of the scope for future reference. Attach the scope to a resource by selecting it from the Select Permissions list under the respective resource. Click Save and Deploy. Navigate to Manage > Lifecycle. Click Publish to publish your API to the Choreo Developer Portal. Create an API and Application in Azure AD: Follow Azure AD documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Azure AD API. Enable External IdP Authentication in Choreo: Create an application in Choreo and configure it to use Azure AD as an external IdP. Invoke the API with Scopes: Use the assigned scopes to authenticate and authorize API invocations. For detailed steps, refer to the Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) documentation. Securing API Access with Asgardeo Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: Similar to the Azure AD steps, assign scopes to your API in Choreo by navigating to Manage > Permissions and following the same steps to add permissions. Create an API and Application in Asgardeo: Follow Asgardeo documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Asgardeo API. Enable External IdP Authentication in Choreo: Create an application in Choreo and configure it to use Asgardeo as an external IdP. Invoke the API with Scopes: Use the assigned scopes to authenticate and authorize API invocations. For detailed steps, refer to the Secure API Access with Asgardeo documentation.",

         "Yes, users can set usage limits for APIs based on different API tiers in Choreo, allowing for varied access permissions depending on subscription types. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **API Tiers**: You can define different tiers for your APIs, each with unique subscription models and associated usage limits.\n  \n2. **Usage Limit Settings**:\n   - For every API tier, you can set:\n     - Minimum invocation count\n     - Maximum invocation count\n     - Request time limit (in minutes)\n\n3. **Automatic Enforcement**:\n   - Once you configure the usage limits and create an API component with that specific API tier, those limits will be enforced automatically for all users purchasing plans under that tier.\n\n### Steps to Configure API Usage Limits:\nTo configure API usage limits, follow these general steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the component you want to manage.\n2. Access the API settings and ensure that `BOTH` mode is enabled in the access control settings. This allows backend authentication tokens to be used without specifying an OAuth scope.\n3. Set up API usage limits according to the selected API tier, including defining:\n   - `maxInvocations`: The maximum number of allowed requests within a specified timeframe. A common setting is `500` requests per minute.\n   - `timeUnit`: Choose the desired time unit (such as minutes).\n   - `requestTimeLimitInMinutes`: Specify the request time limit in minutes.\n\n4. Save your changes.\n\n5. Publish your API component to apply the settings.\n\n6. Create an API plan with the applicable tiers and assign the appropriate limits for those tiers.\n\n7. Finally, promote the API to production and deploy the backend service.\n\n### Visual Representation:\n![Configure API Usage Limits](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/administer/configure-api-usage-limits.png)\n\nFor more detailed information and guidance, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-api-usage-limits/).",

Choreo automatically applies certain rate-limiting settings to improve the performance and stability of your deployments. While Choreo does enforce rate limits, it does not allow for customization via configuration files or source code. The specific rate limits vary depending on the region and environment you are in:\n\n| Region  | Default Rate Limit for API Requests | Default Rate Limit for WebSocket Connections |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| US-South| 10 requests per second            | 10 requests per second                   |\n| EU       | 30 requests per second            | 10 requests per second                   |\n| US-East | 30 requests per second            | 10 requests per second                   |\n\nIf your application consumes a significant number of outgoing messages, you may also encounter throttling for outgoing request traffic, which might affect performance. This default behavior may not meet the requirements of critical applications, so you should consider implementing additional measures if needed.\n\nFor more detailed information about managing incoming and outgoing traffic, please refer to the [Control Traffic](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/control-traffic/) documentation.",

Both modes help ensure that the load on your backend is managed effectively. Here’s how you can apply each:\n\n### Request Throttling\n- **Definition**: This mode limits the number of requests allowed during a specified time window.\n- **How it Works**: You set a threshold, and Choreo automatically adjusts based on this limit, allowing requests without further restrictions once the quota is met.\n- **Use Cases**: Ideal for situations where you want to prevent unexpected spikes in traffic, particularly during promotional periods or for testing purposes.\n\n![Request throttling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/api-management/manage-api-traffic/request-throttling.png)\n\n- **Important Consideration**: It’s essential to configure user-based quotas to avoid blocking legitimate requests unnecessarily.\n\n### Rate Limiting\n- **Definition**: Rate limiting controls the maximum number of requests allowed within a given timeframe.\n- **How it Works**: It prevents single users from overwhelming your backend service. By setting specific rate limits, you can ensure that critical services remain responsive and available to users.\n- **Use Cases**: Suitable when managing sudden traffic spikes, ensuring optimal performance, and protecting your services against abuse.\n- **Advanced Configuration**: In addition to basic settings, you can apply custom headers to better manage request flow.\n\n![Rate-limiting settings](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/api-management/manage-api-traffic/configure-rate-limiting.png)\n\n### Implementation Steps\n1.

         "To perform vulnerability scanning in Choreo using Trivy, there are different approaches depending on whether your component is a service or a Web Application. Here's a step-by-step guide for each scenario:\n\n### Vulnerability Scanning Methodologies\n\n1. **Built-in Vulnerability Scanner**:\n   - This scans your container images to detect vulnerabilities.\n   - The default behavior is to scan new images upon build, allowing you to view past results in the scan history tab.\n   - To enable built-in vulnerability scanning, go to the **DevOps** section in the Choreo Console, navigate to the **Scanners** pane, and then to the **Trivy** card.\n\n2. **Trivy CI Secrets**:\n   - Alternatively, you can enable vulnerability scans through Trivy CI secrets.\n   - In this case, Trivy automatically triggers scans for every commit.\n   - This requires generating a secret at your Git provider and copying the generated token, which must be stored securely (e.g., in GitHub Actions).\n   - You need to include this token in your Dockerfile or CI pipeline script for the scan to run during each deployment.\n\n   ![Trigger image scan with trivy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/references/image-scan-with-trivy.png)\n\n### Building a Container Image\nBefore running the scan, ensure you have built the container image associated with your component. You can do this from the **Component Listing** pane, select your component, click **Build**, and complete the build process.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on building a container image, see the [Build a Container Image](./build-a-container-image.md) document.\n\n### Running a Trivy Scan\nOnce you have enabled vulnerability scanning, running a scan varies depending on your setup:\n\n#### For Built-in Scans:\n1. Navigate to the **Scan History** page in the DevOps section of your component.\n2. Click on **Run Scan** and choose your desired scan type.\n\n![Trivy scan icon](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/references/trivy-icon.png)\n\n![Trivy scan icon](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/references/trivy-run.png)\n\n#### For Trivy CI Secrets:\nYou run the Trivy scan automatically when a new commit is pushed, so it typically does not require manual triggering.\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of vulnerability scanning configurations, including enabling secrets and managing access keys, visit the following documentation:\n- [Enable Security Context Secret Mount](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-secrets-and-security-context/#step-3-enable-security-context-secret-mount)\n- [Create a Container Registry Secret](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-secrets-and-security-context/#step-4-create-a-container-registry-secret)\n\nIf your issue persists, consider checking the following:\n- Ensure that your Git repository URL is configured correctly in the Choreo console.\n- Verify that your component is deployed and ready for scanning.\n\nIf you need further assistance, feel free to ask!",

         "I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely?",
         "To securely manage your secrets and configuration files like secret keys for a React web application in Choreo, you can follow these best practices:\n\n1. **Use Configurations:**\n   - Instead of storing sensitive information directly in your source code, use the built-in configurations feature provided by Choreo. This allows you to manage sensitive data separately from your application logic.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Set environment variables as configurations, which will enable security through encryption during transmission. Environment variables are particularly useful when you need to expose configuration and secret values to components within your project while keeping them confidential.\n\n3. **Secrets:**\n   - Use secrets for data that should not be exposed, such as database passwords or API keys. Secrets are not encrypted on their own, but you can set a token to decrypt them, making them available via environment variables. Note that this means that secrets are only secure if they are not copied into buildpack secrets caches or committed to Git repositories.\n\n4. **Manage Secrets and Configurations:**\n   - To create a configuration or secret, go to the **Component Listing** pane, select your component, and then navigate to the appropriate environments to add configurations or secrets.\n\n5. **Use a Secret Store (if necessary):**\n   - If you have secrets that require management beyond simple configurations and secrets, you can utilize the integrated Secret Store. This feature allows you to define a secret as per its intended usage type and provides options to view, edit, or delete it later if needed.\n\nHere’s a brief overview of the process for adding configurations or secrets:\n\n- **For Configurations**: \n  1. In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then **Configs & Secrets**.\n  2. Click on **+ Create**.\n  3. Define your configuration or secret and follow the prompts to save it.\n\n- **For Secrets**: \n  1. In the left navigation menu, click on **Security** and then **Secrets**.\n  2. Click on **+ Add**.\n  3. Define your secret details and store it.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your secret keys and configurations remain secure and managed effectively within Choreo.\n\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to the official documentation: [Secure Storage Options](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#secure-storage-options).",
         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it. You can create a config file mount via the Configurations pane on the Deploy page in the Choreo Console.",

         "What steps can I take to protect my web app?",
         "To secure your web application effectively within the Choreo environment, follow these recommended steps:\n\n1. **Implement Authentication**: Use the built-in identity provider (IdP) in Choreo for managing user authentication. This includes setting up user management, groups, and roles, which will facilitate secure access control.\n   \n2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: To add an extra layer of security to your web app, enable two-factor authentication for user accounts. This helps prevent unauthorized access by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.\n\n3. **Secure Web Applications**:\n   - Use the provided web application component types to create your application and configure the necessary security settings during deployment.\n   - Ensure that any API invoked through your web application has proper security measures in place, such as rate limiting, throttling, and JWT validations to safeguard against API abuse and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Use Service Chain for Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Implement a service chain with your external identity provider for integrating with Choreo. This allows you to manage user sessions across different applications seamlessly.\n\n5. **Observe Application Security**: Monitor application-level logs and alerts to detect and mitigate any security threats. This can include identifying unusual activity that may indicate a breach or unauthorized access attempt.\n\nFor more detailed information on implementing security measures within Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Protect Your Web App with Managed Identity](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-idp/#step-1-configure-the-built-in-idp-for-your-choreo-account)\n- [Manage Applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#configure-built-in-idp-for-self-sign-up-and-manage-users-in-your-organization)\n- [Develop a Secure Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/develop-a-secure-web-application/)",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component. Using this method you can secure your web application.",

         "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?",
         "To protect an API in Choreo, you can utilize various methods depending on your requirements, primarily through two approaches: OAuth 2.0 Authentication and Asgardeo. Here’s how each works:\n\n### 1. Using Choreo's Built-In Authentication Functionality\nChoreo provides a built-in method for securing APIs that uses the `x-api-key` header. This method grants restricted APIs to authorized keys rather than implementing OAuth. The steps include:\n\n1. **Create an API Proxy**: Deploy the API proxy and define the API path under **Set Up** > **Endpoint Mapping**.\n   \n2. **Enable Security Context**: Go to **Develop** > **Deploy**, where you can enable security context.\n\n3. **Set Up the API Key**: In the **API Info** tab under **Basic Details**, set the **Key Name** and click **Generate** to create the API key.\n\n4. **Deploy the API**: Click **Deploy** to register the API with Choreo.\n\nThis approach allows for secure access without integrating additional tools like Asgardeo.\n\n### 2. Using OAuth 2.0 Authentication\nOAuth 2.0 is another effective method to protect your APIs. It involves creating an application in Choreo and assigning permissions to the API components you wish to secure. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Assign Permissions**: In the Choreo console, select the component you want to secure under **Deploy**.\n   - Click on **Endpoint Configurations**.\n   - In the **Permissions List**, enter a permission name and click **+Add New**.\n   - Assign the desired permissions to the relevant endpoints.\n\n2. **Manage API Key Settings**: After deploying the API, manage API key settings under **Manage** > **API Keys** to retrieve the necessary keys.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively protect your APIs in Choreo using either built-in security or OAuth 2.0.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the documentation on [securing an API with Choreo built-in security](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/) and [secure API access with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/#set-up-an-asgardeo-application).",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Below are the general steps for each approach: Securing API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: In the Component Listing pane, click on your API component. Navigate to Manage > Permissions. Click + Add Permission (Scope). Enter the permission value in the Permission List pane and click + Add New.

         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3.

    "\"To deploy a web application on the Choreo platform, follow these steps:\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n1. Ensure you have the required permissions for your organization. Typically, the minimum required permissions are: **Organization Read**, **Project Read**, and **Project Write**.\\n\\n### Steps to Deploy a Web Application in Choreo\\n1. **Create a Web Application Component**: If you already have an application connected to your Git repository, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, connect your GitHub repository to Choreo by following the [Choreo Connect GitHub Repositories](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/connect-github-repos-choreo/#connect-github-repos-to-choreo) guide.\\n   \\n2. In the left navigation menu of the Choreo Console, click **Deploy**.\\n3. Select your component from the list of components to view the **Deploy** page.\\n4. In the **Set Up** card on the **Deploy** page, ensure you have filled in the mandatory fields such as a display name, name, version, project, label, description, and build pack.\\n5. Click on **Deploy** to start the deployment process. The build configuration will appear once the deployment completes successfully.\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n- Choreo automatically applies best practices like microservices architecture and follows a modular design principle.\\n- After the initial deployment, you can update the source code, apply new configurations, or rebuild your container image when changes are made in the source code repositories linked to the respective components.\\n\\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the official documentation here: [Deploy Your First Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-your-first-web-application/#step-3-deploy-the-web-application).\",\n",
    "\"The \\\"Module not found error\\\" typically occurs when your application cannot locate or access the necessary libraries or files that it needs to run properly. This issue can occur both at the time of deployment and while running the deployed application. Here are some strategies you can use to resolve this error:\\n\\n### Steps to Troubleshoot and Resolve Module Not Found Errors During Deployment:\\n\\n1. **Verify File Paths**: Ensure that all required files (such as configurations, scripts, etc.) are stored in the correct directory. Sometimes, relative paths may cause the module to be inaccessible.\\n\\n   Example: If your `main.py` is located in `/my/project/main.py`, make sure that any other files or directories are accessible through the same path.\\n\\n2. **Check Libraries**: Confirm that all dependencies are included correctly. Missing or incorrectly referenced third-party libraries can cause a `ModuleNotFoundError`.\\n\\n   - Make sure your Dockerfile contains commands to install any necessary dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` (if you're using a Python project). For example:\\n     ```bash\\ncp requirements.txt .\\npip install --upgrade pip\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\n3. **Dockerfile Structure**: If you are using a Dockerfile, ensure it follows best practices:\\n\\n   - Use an explicit `WORKDIR` to avoid potential confusion with environment variables.\\n   - Ensure the command section is clean and separates from the `COPY` section for better readability and maintainability.\\n   \\n   ```Dockerfile\\nFROM python:3.7\\nRUN cp requirements.txt .\\nRUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt\\nCOPY . /app\\nWORKDIR /app\\nENTRYPOINT [\\\"python\\\", \\\"main.py\\\"]\\n# Add other commands here if needed\\n``` \\n\\n4. **Container Image Build Failure**: If there are issues during container image build, the command will return with a non-zero exit status, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. To troubleshoot:\\n\\n   - Clean the cache before building (`docker build -f <path-to-Dockerfile> -t <image-name>:<tag> -ci .`).\\n   - Check if there are any permission errors or file corruption during the build process.\\n\\n5. **CI/CD Process**: Ensure your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes are configured correctly:\\n\\n   - Check if your component has set up a proper build pack. The build pack handles compiling your code, packaging it into a container image, and pushing it to your preferred cloud environment.\\n   - Verify that all environment variables are properly defined and assigned to their respective components.\\n\\n6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Use logging and monitoring tools within your Choreo Console to track any deployment failures and monitor application logs for clues.\\n\\n### Common Error Messages:\\n- **No module named 'some_module'**: This indicates that `some_module.py` cannot be found.\\n- **Error reading the manifest file**: This may occur if there are missing or incorrectly formatted dependencies.\\n\\nFor more detailed troubleshooting, you can refer to the following links in the Choreo documentation:\\n- [Builds & Deployments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build-and-deploy)\\n- [Build a Container Image From Scratch](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/create-container-image-from-scratch/)\",\n",
    "\"To enhance the security and privacy of your service interactions in Choreo, incorporating authentication mechanisms is essential. Here’s how to configure basic security for REST services, which can then be extended to service-to-service and service-to-user communication.\\n\\n### Adding Basic Security to a Service\\n\\n1. **Select Your Component**: In the Choreo Console, locate the component you wish to secure. If you need to generate new credentials, navigate to **Deploy** > **Endpoint Configurations** under the **Set Up** card.\\n\\n2. **Define Endpoints**: Identify the endpoints that require protection from unauthorized access. Ensure these endpoints include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or TRACE operations, as they may be exposed via standard API proxies.\\n\\n3. **Configure Endpoint Scopes**: Specify scopes for each endpoint. These are identifiers that describe permissions attached to a resource. This is crucial because you will later apply roles to these scopes during role-based access control. Note that scopes must be defined explicitly, similar to setting tags for a cloud-native database connection. Use appropriate names for scopes to define permissions effectively.\\n\\n4. **Set Authentication Level**: In the **Deploy** section, select **Basic Security with OAuth** as the authentication level. Configure the necessary options for this method, including selecting your identity provider.\\n\\n5. **Protect the Endpoint**: To test your secured endpoint, go back to the **Develop** section, click on **Test**, set up test users, and initiate a test request. Upon successful deployment, the Invoke page will display details about the deployed endpoint.\\n\\n### Extending Authentication\\n\\nOnce basic authentication is configured, it’s advisable to upgrade your component to an OAuth application if you plan on implementing a full OAuth2.0 flow. This allows you to manage user tokens effectively and handle API subscriptions more rigorously.\\n\\nFor detailed guidance on configuring an Identity Provider for your service, please refer to the [Choreo documentation on adding basic authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-basic-authentication-for-a-component/#step-3-set-up-the-identity-provider-for-your-component).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can secure your service with appropriate measures ensuring safe interaction and enhanced protection against unauthorized access.\",\n",
    "\"To add a custom domain for your web application in Choreo, follow these steps:\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n1. **Admin Privileges**: Ensure you have admin privileges in your organization.\\n2. **Custom Domain Ready to Use**: You should have already created a domain for your web application in the Choreo Developer Portal.\\n\\n### Steps to Add a Custom Domain\\n\\n1. In the Choreo Console, go to the top navigation menu and click on **Organization**. Then select your organization from the list.\\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**.\\n3. On the Organization Settings page, click on the **URL Settings** tab and then the **Active Domains** tab.\\n4. Click on **+ Add Domains**.\\n5. In the **Add a Custom Domain** pane, specify your desired domain name, select the environment, and choose the entity type (API, Web App, etc.) and the component.\\n6. After that, generate the requisite SSL certificates and add them to the DNS provider. Once done, verify the CNAME record during the next step.\\n7. Copy the custom URL template generated by Choreo and paste it into your DNS settings. This will allow you to create a DNS record for your domain.\\n8. Upon successful verification of the CNAME mapping, a custom URL will be provisioned for your application in the Developer Portal and your component in the Choreo console.\\n9. Finally, redirect your user traffic via the generated custom URL.\\n\\nFor detailed steps and additional options related to the TLS certificate, refer to the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#add-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization).\",\n",

Note that this means that secrets are only secure if they are not copied into buildpack secrets caches or committed to Git repositories.\\n\\n4. **Manage Secrets and Configurations:**\\n   - To create a configuration or secret, go to the **Component Listing** pane, select your component, and then navigate to the appropriate environments to add configurations or secrets.\\n\\n5. **Use a Secret Store (if necessary):**\\n   - If you have secrets that require management beyond simple configurations and secrets, you can utilize the integrated Secret Store. This feature allows you to define a secret as per its intended usage type and provides options to view, edit, or delete it later if needed.\\n\\nHere’s a brief overview of the process for adding configurations or secrets:\\n\\n- **For Configurations**: \\n  1. In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then **Configs & Secrets**.\\n  2. Click on **+ Create**.\\n  3. Define your configuration or secret and follow the prompts to save it.\\n\\n- **For Secrets**: \\n  1. In the left navigation menu, click on **Security** and then **Secrets**.\\n  2. Click on **+ Add**.\\n  3. Define your secret details and store it.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your secret keys and configurations remain secure and managed effectively within Choreo.\\n\\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to the official documentation: [Secure Storage Options](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#secure-storage-options).\",\n",
    "\"To secure your web application effectively within the Choreo environment, follow these recommended steps:\\n\\n1. **Implement Authentication**: Use the built-in identity provider (IdP) in Choreo for managing user authentication. This includes setting up user management, groups, and roles, which will facilitate secure access control.\\n   \\n2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: To add an extra layer of security to your web app, enable two-factor authentication for user accounts. This helps prevent unauthorized access by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.\\n\\n3. **Secure Web Applications**:\\n   - Use the provided web application component types to create your application and configure the necessary security settings during deployment.\\n   - Ensure that any API invoked through your web application has proper security measures in place, such as rate limiting, throttling, and JWT validations to safeguard against API abuse and potential vulnerabilities.\\n\\n4. **Use Service Chain for Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Implement a service chain with your external identity provider for integrating with Choreo. This allows you to manage user sessions across different applications seamlessly.\\n\\n5. **Observe Application Security**: Monitor application-level logs and alerts to detect and mitigate any security threats. This can include identifying unusual activity that may indicate a breach or unauthorized access attempt.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on implementing security measures within Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Protect Your Web App with Managed Identity](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-idp/#step-1-configure-the-built-in-idp-for-your-choreo-account)\\n- [Manage Applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#configure-built-in-idp-for-self-sign-up-and-manage-users-in-your-organization)\\n- [Develop a Secure Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/develop-a-secure-web-application/)\",\n",
    "\"To protect an API in Choreo, you can utilize various methods depending on your requirements, primarily through two approaches: OAuth 2.0 Authentication and Asgardeo. Here’s how each works:\\n\\n### 1. Using Choreo's Built-In Authentication Functionality\\nChoreo provides a built-in method for securing APIs that uses the `x-api-key` header. This method grants restricted APIs to authorized keys rather than implementing OAuth. The steps include:\\n\\n1. **Create an API Proxy**: Deploy the API proxy and define the API path under **Set Up** > **Endpoint Mapping**.\\n   \\n2. **Enable Security Context**: Go to **Develop** > **Deploy**, where you can enable security context.\\n\\n3. **Set Up the API Key**: In the **API Info** tab under **Basic Details**, set the **Key Name** and click **Generate** to create the API key.\\n\\n4. **Deploy the API**: Click **Deploy** to register the API with Choreo.\\n\\nThis approach allows for secure access without integrating additional tools like Asgardeo.\\n\\n### 2. Using OAuth 2.0 Authentication\\nOAuth 2.0 is another effective method to protect your APIs. It involves creating an application in Choreo and assigning permissions to the API components you wish to secure. Here are the steps:\\n\\n1. **Assign Permissions**: In the Choreo console, select the component you want to secure under **Deploy**.\\n   - Click on **Endpoint Configurations**.\\n   - In the **Permissions List**, enter a permission name and click **+Add New**.\\n   - Assign the desired permissions to the relevant endpoints.\\n\\n2. **Manage API Key Settings**: After deploying the API, manage API key settings under **Manage** > **API Keys** to retrieve the necessary keys.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively protect your APIs in Choreo using either built-in security or OAuth 2.0.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the documentation on [securing an API with Choreo built-in security](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/) and [secure API access with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/#set-up-an-asgardeo-application).\",\n",

         "To connect your backend deployed in Choreo to your frontend application hosted on GitHub Pages, you need to follow a structured approach. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n### Steps to Connect Frontend and Backend\n\n1. **Ensure Your Frontend is Deployed**:\n   - Make sure that your frontend application is already deployed on GitHub Pages. This means it should be accessible via its URL.\n\n2. **Obtain the Backend URL**:\n   - After successfully deploying your backend in Choreo, note down the `Endpoint` URL provided during the deployment process. This will be the endpoint from which your frontend can communicate.\n\n3. **Update your Frontend Application**:\n   - In your frontend code, update any references to your backend services. Typically, this would involve hardcoding the backend URL if your frontend and backend are separate components (like in your case). \n   - For example, if you have hardcoded a relative URL, replace it with the absolute URL of the Choreo endpoint.\n\n4. **Set Up Environment Variables (if needed)**:\n   - If there is a need to pass sensitive data or configuration specific to the production environment, you can use environment variables in GitHub Actions to manage these securely. This helps maintain good practices regarding secrets management.\n\n5. **Implement CORS (if necessary)**:\n   - Ensure that your backend allows cross-origin requests from your frontend by configuring CORS settings. This might require updating the network configurations within Choreo.\n\n6. **Testing**:\n   - After making the necessary changes, perform testing to ensure that the frontend can successfully interact with the backend as expected.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- The connection between the two must be done post-deployment, so it's crucial to have both applications functional and ready before establishing communication.\n- If you face any network-related issues, check the permissions and any firewall settings both on Choreo and your GitHub Pages site.\n\n### Additional Resources\nFor more details on managing configurations and secrets, you can refer to the documentation on [Managing Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#use-environment-variables-in-github-actions).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to connect your backend deployed in Choreo with your frontend application hosted on GitHub Pages effectively.",

For instance, `/healthz` or `/health` are common paths to query.\n   - **HTTP POST Request**: This option allows sending an `HTTP POST` request to a specified port and path, which is less commonly used for readiness checks.\n   - **Execute Command**: Running a script inside the container, like checking file permissions or CPU/RAM utilization, is also an option.\n\n6. **Set Conditions**: Define any conditions that must be met for the readiness probe to trigger.\n7. **Save Your Settings**: Once configured, click **Save** to apply the readiness probe.\n8. **Redeploy if Necessary**: If your component does not already have network visibility, go to the **Deploy** page and click **Update Image & Deploy** to ensure the probe is activated.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Readiness probes do not run at regular intervals like liveness probes but execute only once per deployment lifecycle unless manually triggered or the status of a resource changes.\n- These probes are essential for managing load balancing and ensuring smooth application operations, particularly in auto-scaling configurations.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the [Configure Health Checks](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-health-checks/) documentation.",
         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to configure readiness probes.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

         "If you are encountering Trivy security check errors in Choreo, you can troubleshoot these issues by following several steps to identify and resolve potential problems.\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps\n\n1. **Check Component Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that your component's configuration correctly specifies the required ports, network types, and other parameters necessary for secure connections. This can vary based on the type of project you have (for instance, it differs between Service projects and Web Application projects).\n   - Verify that the project-level endpoints are configured properly to reflect how your services will interact with each other.\n   - Make sure to enable the **Health Check** and configure the health probe if needed, as failing health checks can cause errors during deployments.\n\n2. **Use Dependency Track UI for Security Vulnerabilities**:\n   - If your component has dependencies with known vulnerabilities, consider using the [Dependency Track UI](https://security.trivy.io/) to analyze your project's dependencies.\n   - Identify the libraries with security vulnerabilities and determine if they are being used incorrectly, such as passing sensitive data without proper encoding.\n   \n3. **Scan Configurations and Build Logs**:\n   - If you're facing \"build scan failed\" errors, check the **Build Logs** pane for specific error messages and ensure that the credentials or configurations used in the build process are correct.\n\n4. **Manage Network Visibility Settings**:\n   - Be aware that visibility settings (Public, Organization, or Project) for API components can impact connectivity. If there are network visibility mismatches, you may encounter errors related to unauthorized access or connection refused.\n\n5. **Review Build and Scan Pipelines**:\n   - It's crucial to validate your builds before running scans or pushing to production. If a scan detects security vulnerabilities, review the build pipeline to confirm it successfully completes.\n\nBy carefully reviewing these steps and ensuring that all configurations and network settings are appropriate for your application, you should be able to resolve the Trivy security check errors effectively.\n\nFor more detailed information on handling Trivy scan results and managing vulnerability notifications, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Configure and Manage Vulnerability Scanning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/scan/dependency-scan/configure-and-manage-vulnerability-scanning/)\n- [Handle Vulnerability Notifications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/alerts-and-notifications/manage-vulnerability-notifications/#handle-vulnerability-notifications)",

If critical vulnerabilities are found, the deployment process will halt. The Trivy scan status and any security failures are displayed in the deployment pane. Click on the Library (Trivy) vulnerable scan step to view the details of the vulnerabilities. Fix the Vulnerabilities: Fix the Identified Vulnerabilities: The best approach to resolving these errors is to address the identified vulnerabilities in your code or dependencies. Update or replace the vulnerable libraries with their secure versions. Ignore the Vulnerabilities (Temporarily): Create a .trivyignore File: If you cannot fix a critical CVE immediately, you can choose to ignore the vulnerability by creating a .trivyignore file. Add the .trivyignore file to your Docker build context path. For example, {buildContextPath}/.trivyignore. In the .trivyignore file, list the CVEs you want to ignore, one per line: CVE-2023-xxxx CVE-2023-yyyy CVE-2023-xxxx Redeploy the Component: Rebuild and Redeploy the Component: After fixing or ignoring the vulnerabilities: Rebuild your component by triggering a new build in the Builds pane.",

         "To configure a **.json** or **.yaml** configuration file for a web application deployed to Choreo, follow these guidelines and steps:\n\n### Configuration File Support\nChoreo supports configuration files in either JSON or YAML format, with a file extension that matches the content type. The configuration files should be stored in Git. These files allow you to manage variable configurations that can vary across different environments like development, staging, and production.\n\n### Best Practices\n1. **Keep sensitive data secure**: Use configuration files instead of environment variables for sensitive information like passwords, access tokens, and keys.\n2. **Environment-specific values**: Override default values defined in your configuration file by defining environment-specific variables during deployment.\n3. **Version control**: Ensure that your configuration files are committed to your repository but exclude sensitive information from being published.\n\n### Excluding Files from Version Control\nIf your project contains sensitive information like database credentials or OAuth tokens in the configuration files, you can exclude them from version control by using the following approaches:\n\n#### `.gitignore` File\n1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your root directory if you don't have one already.\n2. Add the paths to the configuration files you want to exclude, for example:\n   ```\n   config/credentials.yaml\n   config/secrets.json\n   ```\n3. Commit the `.gitignore` file and the configuration files to ensure they are excluded from being committed to the repository.\n\n#### `github-secrets` GitHub Action (recommended)\nFor added security, you can utilize the `github-secrets` GitHub Action to manage secrets efficiently:\n1. Go to the **Settings** of your GitHub repository and click on **Secrets**.\n2. Create a new secret with a name that reflects its purpose.\n3. Paste the content of your configuration file into the **Raw Secret** editor window.\n4. Click **Add Secret**.\n\n### Example Configuration File\nHere's a sample configuration file to give you an idea:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  host: \"0.0.0.0\"\n  port: 8090\nendpoints:\n  - name: Endpoint 1\n    host: \"endpoint1-host\"\n    port: 8080\n  - name: Endpoint 2\n    host: \"endpoint2-host\"\n    port: 8070\n```\n\nBy adhering to these best practices and guidelines, you can effectively manage configuration files for your web application within Choreo.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Manage Configurations and Secrets documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#best-practices).",

Here’s how to enable it:\n\n1. **Access Component:** In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the web application you want to configure.\n2. **Manage Settings:** Go to the **Settings** option in the left navigation menu.\n3. **Authentication Keys Tab:** Navigate to the **Authentication Keys** tab.\n4. **Choose Identity Provider:** Select **Choreo Built-in Identity Provider** as the identity provider and specify the appropriate audiences.\n5. **Configure:** Click **Configure** to generate client keys and copy the discovery URL.\n6. **Enable Secure Web App:** Turn on the **Secure Web Application** toggle and paste the discovery URL you copied earlier.\n7. **Save Changes:** Finally, click **Apply**.\n\nThis configuration ensures that your web application securely handles user authentication using industry-standard protocols.\n\nFor detailed steps, check [Configure Managed Authentication for a Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-the-web-application).\n\n### 2. Enable External Authentication with a Third-Party Identity Provider (IdP)\nYou can also integrate an external identity provider to manage user authentication. Follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Select Your Organization:** From the **Project Listing** pane, select your project.\n2. **Navigate to Component:** In the left navigation menu, click on **Settings** and then select the **Authentication Keys** tab.\n3. **Add IdP Credentials:** Under the **Identity Providers** section, add your chosen IdP’s credentials and follow the respective guidelines for the IdP you are using (e.g., Azure Active Directory, Asgardeo, etc.).\n\nEnsure to select the appropriate audiences and set the `code` as the grant type. After this setup, Choreo will redirect users to your configured IdP for authentication, and upon successful sign-in, it will callback with the tokens needed for authorization.\n\nFor more details, visit [Configure Third-Party Authentication for the Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-2-enable-external-authentication-for-the-web-application).\n\n### 3. Leverage Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\nYou can assign roles to users via your external IdP or through Choreo’s built-in Identity Provider. Ensure that the roles assigned correspond to the necessary permissions for the services users will access.\n\nFor further information on configuring role-based access control, see the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-3-set-up-role-based-access-control-for-your-web-application).\n\nBy following these steps, you can enhance the security of your web application within the Choreo ecosystem effectively.\n\nFor comprehensive guides, refer to the full documentation at: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/).",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs.

         "To set up alerts for your service in Choreo, you can configure either latency alerts or traffic alerts. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do both: Setting Up Traffic Alerts Traffic alerts notify you when the request count of an API exceeds a predefined threshold. This is useful for managing APIs with backend traffic limits or monetized backends that require proactive scaling based on incoming traffic. Ensure you are in the correct organization where you have a project with the API to configure a traffic alert. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click Usage Insights. In the left navigation menu on the Usage Insights page, click Alerts. Click the Environment list and select the required environment. Click Alert Configuration. This opens the Alert Configuration pane. Click the Traffic tab. In the API Name field, select the API for which you want to configure the alert. Only the APIs that you have invoked at least once are listed here. For other APIs, you need to give the API name in the required format as instructed in the UI. In the Metric field, select the required metric against which you want to evaluate the alert configuration. In the Threshold field, specify the threshold number of requests per minute. If required, specify the list of emails that should be notified when the alert is generated in the Emails field. Click Add. Once an alert is successfully added, the alert configuration is listed in the Alert Configuration pane. Each configuration can be edited and removed via this pane. Setting Up Latency Alerts Latency alerts notify you if the response latency of an API exceeds a predefined threshold. This is useful for APIs that need to meet specific SLAs and for proactively identifying slow APIs. Ensure you are in the correct organization where you have a project with the API to configure a latency alert. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click Usage Insights. In the left navigation menu on the Usage Insights page, click Alerts. Click the Environment list and select the required environment. Click Alert Configuration. This opens the Alert Configuration pane with the Latency tab open by default. In the API Name field, select the API for which you want to configure the alert.

         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)\nHorizontal pod autoscaler automatically scales the replicas of a component based on resource consumption metrics like CPU and memory thresholds. This allows your application to handle varying loads dynamically.\n\n**Steps to configure HPA:**\n- In the **Component Listing** pane, select the component you want to scale.\n- Navigate to the **DevOps** section and click on **Autoscale**.\n- Click on **Configure** next to **Horizontal Scaling** to set up the HPA.\n  \n  ![Configure HPA](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/configure-approach-02.png)\n\n#### Setting Min & Max Replicas:\n| Container Running Status | Meaning                                                        |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Minimum Replicas        | Ensures there is at least one replica available. <br> If CPU/memory threshold is not crossed, it will be increased up to this limit.<br> Set to `1` for production use cases.<br>(Default: `1`).<br>|<br> |Maximum Replicas    | Prevents the replicas from exceeding this number, even if CPU/memory threshold is crossed. <br> The value is used after reaching the minimum. <br>(Default: `5`).<br>| <br>\n\n### 2. Configure Dynamic Provisions Storage Class\nFor components that require a persistent volume (like databases), Choreo uses **Dynamic Provisioning** to automatically create storage volumes when the required space exceeds the allocated limit.\n\n**Steps to enable Dynamic Provisioning for storage:**\n- In the **DevOps** section, go to **Storage**.\n- Create a storage class and ensure the **Dynamic Provisioning** checkbox is selected. Specify a **Storage Capacity Limit**.\n\n  ![Create Storage](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/storage/create-storage-class.png)\n\n#### Storage Classes and Priorities:\nWhen requesting storage, lower-priority classes can automatically upgrade to a higher class if space reaches the allocated limit.\n\n### Additional Information\n- If a request is made to a lower priority storage class, it will not affect other critical services running in the same namespace.\n- Ensure that your deployment does not run out of storage abruptly by setting appropriate capacity limits.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, ensuring efficient resource management.\n\nFor more detailed information, refer to the documentation here: [Auto-scaling components with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/aut-scale-with-hpa/#auto-scale-components-with-horizontal-pod-autoscaler).",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "To limit requests coming to your API in Choreo, you have two primary methods: utilizing rate limiting at the API level or applying a blackout time at the API key level.\n\n### 1. **Rate Limiting at the API Level**\nYou can apply different rate limit plans when you deploy your API. This is essential for preventing API overload and ensuring smooth performance for users. Here’s how to do it:\n\n- Navigate to the **Deploy** section.\n- On the **Set Up** card, click **Rate Limiting** to expand the settings.\n- Select a rate limit plan that suits your requirements from the available options and apply it to your API.\n\nThis will help manage the load and prevent any single user from consuming too much of the API's resources.\n\n### 2. **Blackout Time at the API Key Level**\nIf you want to further control the usage of your API by limiting the amount of time that the API key is active, you can set a blackout period. This is useful if you observe high traffic during specific times or need to manage sudden spikes in usage.\n\n- In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**.\n- Go to the **API Configuration** tab and then to the **Developer Portal** tab.\n- Here, you can edit the API key details and set the appropriate blackout time as per your needs.\n\nThis feature ensures that if too many requests are made within a short time frame, it helps to mitigate any potential overload.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the following documents:\n- [Limit Requests Coming to My API - Rate Limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/#limit-requests-coming-to-my-api)\n- [Limit Requests Coming to My API - Black Out Time](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/#limit-requests-coming-to-my-api--blackout-time)\n\nThese steps should help you effectively manage the request load on your API.",

         "To manage traffic coming to your API in Choreo, you can implement both rate limiting and throttling mechanisms depending on your needs.\n\n### Rate Limiting\nRate limiting helps protect your backend from being overwhelmed by requests and can also serve as a protective measure against malicious attacks. When rate limiting is enabled, every API invocation consumes units of quota defined in the subscription plan. Once the specified quota is exceeded, the request will return an `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` status.\n\nHere’s how you can enable **API rate-limiting** during deployment:\n\n1. Go to the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.\n2. In the **Set Up** card, click **API Configuration**.\n3. Select the **Rate Limiting** tab, choose **Request Limiting**, and specify:\n   - **Limit Type**: Select `Bucket`.\n   - **Duration**: Choose a time unit (like minute, hour, day).\n   - **Requests**: Enter the number of requests.\n4. Click **Apply** to save your changes.\n5. Build and deploy the component again.\n6. Publish the API.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the documentation here: [Control Traffic with Rate Limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/control-traffic-with-rate-limiting/#enable-api-rate-limiting-during-deployment).\n\n### Throttling\nThrottling allows you to manage the load on your API by controlling the rate at which client applications can submit requests. It helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair usage.\n\nYou can set up API throttling through subscription plans:\n\n1. When creating or updating a subscription plan, go to the desired plan's **Create Subscription Plan** page.\n2. Under the **Developer Portal** section, select a minimum and maximum limit under **Throttle Levels**.\n\nFor further details on managing throttling, you can check this documentation: [Control Traffic with API Throttling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/control-traffic-with-api-throttling/).\n\nIn summary, you can effectively control the traffic coming to your API by leveraging rate limiting to manage request quotas and throttling to monitor and restrict API usage, thereby ensuring optimal performance and security.",

Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component. Using this method you can secure your web application.",

         "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?",
         "There are several methods and best practices you can utilize to secure APIs in Choreo. Here’s a comprehensive overview:\n\n### 1. API Security Levels\nChoreo provides varying security levels for APIs:\n- **Public**: Open to anyone who requests it.\n- **Internal**: Accessible only within the organization's data plane.\n- **Private**: Only accessible via an API key or shared secret within the same application.\n\n### 2. Protecting APIs with Roles and Access Control\nYou can implement roles and access control to manage user permissions effectively:\n\n#### A. Implement Role-Based Access Control\n1. Define roles in your identity provider (IdP) with appropriate permissions.\n2. Configure Choreo components to use these roles:\n   - Navigate to the **Project** page.\n   - Click on the component to configure access.\n   - Specify application groups and select roles from the IdP.\n3. Assign users to application groups in the IdP.\n4. Manage role assignments through the Choreo Console.\n\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to [Configure Role-Based Access Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-role-based-authorization/).\n\n### 3. Secure API Invocation Using an Application\n1. Create an application in Choreo:\n   - Click **+ Create** under Applications in the Developer Portal.\n   - Fill in the details and set the application level permissions.\n\n2. Configure API Access:\n   - Go to **Settings** of your API.\n   - Navigate to the **Subscription Key Generation** tab.\n   - Generate an API subscription.\n\n### 4. Implement OAuth 2.0 for API Security\nUsing OAuth 2.0 is a robust way to secure APIs:\n- Ensure your application supports authorization codes with PKCE.\n- Use a JWT audience claim for endpoint-specific access.\n- Implement a refresh token to automatically renew API keys if necessary.\n\nFor further details on securing APIs with OAuth 2.0, check out the [Secure API Access With OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-oauth2/).\n\n### Additional Recommendations\n- Regularly update authentication libraries to prevent vulnerabilities.\n- Employ secure coding practices to minimize risks.\n- Monitor API usage and response times to identify any anomalies.\n\nBy implementing these methods, you can significantly enhance the security of your APIs in Choreo. For further information, please refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Secure API Access With OAuth 2.0](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-oauth2/#generate-an-access-token-via-the-authentication-flow)\n- [Protect APIs With Role-Based Access Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-role-based-authorization/)",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Below are the general steps for each approach: Securing API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: In the Component Listing pane, click on your API component. Navigate to Manage > Permissions. Click + Add Permission (Scope). Enter the permission value in the Permission List pane and click + Add New. Copy the fully qualified name of the scope for future reference. Attach the scope to a resource by selecting it from the Select Permissions list under the respective resource. Click Save and Deploy. Navigate to Manage > Lifecycle. Click Publish to publish your API to the Choreo Developer Portal. Create an API and Application in Azure AD: Follow Azure AD documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Azure AD API. Enable External IdP Authentication in Choreo: Create an application in Choreo and configure it to use Azure AD as an external IdP. Invoke the API with Scopes: Use the assigned scopes to authenticate and authorize API invocations. For detailed steps, refer to the Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) documentation. Securing API Access with Asgardeo Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: Similar to the Azure AD steps, assign scopes to your API in Choreo by navigating to Manage > Permissions and following the same steps to add permissions. Create an API and Application in Asgardeo: Follow Asgardeo documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Asgardeo API.

         "To enable automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Navigate to Your Component**: In the left navigation menu, click on the component for which you want to manage scaling.\n  \n2. **Access DevOps Settings**: In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then select **Scaling**.\n\n3. **Enable Scaling**: Turn on the **scale-to-zero** toggle. This setting allows your application to automatically scale down to zero replicas when there is no traffic, while ensuring it scales up to handle incoming requests when needed.\n\n4. **Set Minimum and Maximum Replicas**: Adjust the **Minimum replicas** slider to define the least number of active replicas you want to maintain. Set the **Maximum replicas** slider to indicate the maximum number of replicas your application should have, which will depend on your infrastructure setup.\n\n5. **Manage Scale-to-Zero Settings**: Expand the **Scale-to-Zero** section to access additional settings:\n   - **Requests on the Health Endpoint**: Set a request size limit (in bytes) for the health check endpoint. If the response exceeds this limit, the endpoint is considered unhealthy.\n   - **Health Check Types**: Choose between different health checks:\n     - **Port TCP Probe**: Establishes a TCP connection on a specified port; a failed attempt indicates a health issue.\n     - **HTTP GET Request**: Sends an HTTP GET request to the configured `health endpoint`. A status code outside the range of 200-399 is considered a failure.\n     - **HTTP GET Heartbeat Probe**: Similar to the HTTP GET request but periodically sends heartbeat messages instead of checking the status code.\n     - **Execute a Command**: Runs a shell command; a non-zero return value indicates an error. Note that these commands run inside a non-root `Linux` container.\n\n6. **Apply Changes**: Click **Update** to save your changes.\n\nThis process enables your application to scale dynamically, reducing costs during low demand and ensuring availability during peak usage.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scaling-to-zero/#set-up-autoscaling-for-your-container).",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "My service gets overloaded with requests how to fix this?",
         "If your service is getting overloaded with requests in Choreo, there are several strategies you can employ to manage or prevent further issues:\n\n1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: This is a common technique to control the rate at which clients can access your service. By setting rate limits, you can protect your backend from receiving more requests than it can handle.\n   \n2. **Request Queuing**: If rate limiting isn’t sufficient, request queuing allows incoming requests to queue when the server reaches its maximum connection limit, thereby ensuring requests don’t get lost.\n\n3. **Horizontal Scaling**: Increasing the number of replicas of your service can help distribute the load more efficiently across multiple instances. This method is particularly effective when demand spikes suddenly.\n\n4. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automate the scaling of replicas based on resource consumption and traffic. This ensures that your service can scale up automatically during periods of high activity, thus managing the load better.\n\n5. **API Throttling**: If necessary, you can apply throttling levels to limit API usage, especially if it’s causing performance issues.\n\n6. **Check Logs**: Monitor the logs to identify patterns and understand the nature of the overload. This may provide insights into what triggers the overload and guide your mitigation efforts.\n\n7. **Communication**: Keep your users informed about any capacity limitations through appropriate error messages or notifications.\n\nBy considering these methods, you can effectively manage your service's response to high traffic and ensure it operates optimally.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Manage API rate limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/)\n- [Set Up Dynamic Scaling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/set-up-dynamic-scaling-for-your-container/#configure-autoscaling-for-container-components)",
         "Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon.

Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count.

      "  \"It's important to note that \\\"Module not found\\\" errors generally occur when you try to import a module or package that can't be found during the development or deployment process of your Python project. This type of error is more common in development environments than production. Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue during deployment:  ### 1. **Check Project Environment**    - Ensure your development environment matches the production environment. This includes:      - **Python Version**: Verify the Python version used in both environments.      - **Virtual Environments**: Confirm if you are using a virtual environment (e.g., `virtualenv` or `conda`) and that it’s activated in your deployment environment.        Example command to activate a virtual environment in a terminal:    ```sh    source /path/to/venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS    venv\\Scripts\\\\activate               # On Windows    ```  ### 2. **Inspect Package Installation**    - **Ensure Installation Paths**: The installation directory needs to be added to the PYTHONPATH or similar system variable depending on your deployment method (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).    - **Use a Local Interpreter**: Sometimes, specifying a local interpreter can help avoid dependency conflicts. For example, in `requirements.txt`, you might see something like:      ```sh      python3/dist-packages/my_module/      ```  ### 3. **Dependency Resolution**    - Use the appropriate tools to manage your dependencies. Popular options include `pip` for package installations and `setuptools` and `wheel` for building and installing packages from source.    - Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to create a list of all installed modules.    - Or use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install specified dependencies.     ### 4. **Review Import Syntax**    - Make sure there are no syntax errors or typos when importing modules. Double-check import statements in your Python files. For instance:      ```python      import sys      import mymodule      ```  ### 5. **Environment Variable Issues**    - Sometimes, issues may arise because a required environment variable is not set correctly. Check your application’s configuration or Dockerfile/environment file for any missing variables.  ### 6. **Debugging Specific Issues**    - For specific error messages related to missing imports, consider these debugging steps:      - Run the `setup.py` file (if present in your project) with a verbose mode to ensure proper installation of the required packages.      - Check for specific import failures by commenting out code chunks until the error is narrowed down.  ### 7. **Documentation Review**    - If the error persists, refer back to the documentation of your deployment system or tool (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes YAML, Cloud Formation). It may detail how to set up the required environments or dependencies properly.  Remember that troubleshooting such issues requires detailed inspection of your project files and the specific build process being used. Always refer to the specific documentation related to your deployment strategy for precise instructions.  If you need help with a particular aspect related to Choreo or related integrations, feel free to ask!\",\n",

      "  \"Connecting a React frontend to the backend depends on several factors such as the technology stack you are using, the API design, and security requirements. However, here’s a basic guide on how to integrate a simple RESTful backend with a React frontend:  ### Step 1: Create Your Backend Service For this example, we will use Node.js and Express as the backend framework along with a fictional API.  #### Install Necessary Packages ```bash npm install express axios body-parser ```  #### Create Backend App ```javascript // server.js (backend) const express = require('express'); const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); const app = express(); app.use(bodyParser.json());  app.post('/api/register', (req, res) => {   const { name } = req.body;   // Here, process data and send back response   res.status(200).json({ message: 'User registered' }); });  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;  app.listen(PORT, () => {   console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`); }); ```  #### Running Your Backend Run your backend with the following command: ```bash node server.js ``` You can access it at `http://localhost:3000/api/register`.  ### Step 2: Create Your Frontend Using React Now, create a simple React component to call this API endpoint.  ```jsx // components/Register.js import React, { useState } from 'react'; import axios from 'axios';  const Register = ({ onSuccess }) => {   const [name, setName] = useState('');    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {     e.preventDefault();      try {       await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/register', { name });        onSuccess && onSuccess();     } catch (error) {       console.error('Error:', error);     }   };    return (     <form onSubmit={\\handleSubmit}>       <label htmlFor=\\\"name\\\">Name:</label>       <input type=\\\"text\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />       <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Register</button>     </form>   ); };  export default Register; ```  ### Step 3: Run Both Backend & Frontend  Make sure you have both your backend and frontend running simultaneously.  1. Keep one terminal window open with your backend running and another one open to start your React app.  2. Use Webpack Dev Server for both parts:    - For Backend (`server.js`):      ```bash      node_modules/.bin/webpack serve --config ./webpack.config.js --open      ```     - For Frontend (`components/Register.js`):      First, make sure your React app has started, then open the same directory in a new terminal and run:      ```bash      npm run serve      ```     - Note that when you open multiple terminals, ensure your local server is accessible from the React client side.  ### Additional Considerations: 1. **Cross-Origin Requests**: If your frontend and backend are served from different origins (e.g., your React build folder on localhost), you might need to set up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) on your backend. For development, this could be handled in your development environment.  2. **Security**: For real-world applications, add validation to handle incorrect user input, errors, etc. Also, consider adding encryption for sensitive information (like passwords) via HTTPS and security practices (like rate limiting, session management, and error handling).  Remember to review the official Choreo documentation and best practices to optimize performance and security for production-level applications.\",\n",

      "  \"To implement rate limiting on your APIs in Choreo, follow these steps:  ### Step 1: Create an API Blueprint Ensure you have defined your API in Choreo using its API blueprint format. You can find detailed guidelines on how to create API blueprints [here](https://docs.choreo.io/user-guide.html#creating-api-blueprint).  ### Step 2: Enable Rate Limiting in Your API Blueprint 1. In your API blueprint, add the `RateLimiting` feature. For example:    ```yaml    name: my-api    ...    endpoints:      /my-endpoint:        get:          requestMapping:            parameters:              - in: header                name: X-API-Key                description: Unique Key for accessing the endpoint                style: formurlencoded              - in: header                name: X-Rate-Limit-Header                required: false                type: string            responses:              200:                application/json: \\{\\}            operationId: get-my-endpoint          ...          securityDefinitions:            ApiKeySecurity:              type: api_key              in: header              x-choreo-name: X-API-Key              description: Unique Key for accessing the endpoint            RateLimiting:              type: x-rate-limit              in: header              x-choreo-name: X-Rate-Limit-Header              required: false              x-default-max-age: 86400  # Maximum age of the request in seconds (one day)              x-default-max-requests: 500  # Maximum number of requests allowed per client              x-default-burst: 1000  # Maxiumum number of simultaneous requests    ```  ### Step 3: Apply Rate Limiting Configuration Set up the rate limit settings according to your needs. The above example defines: - **Maximum Age:** 86400 seconds (One day) - **Maximum Requests:** 500 per client - **Burst:** 1000 maximum simultaneous requests  ### Step 4: Deploy Your API Blueprint After configuring the rate limit settings, deploy your updated API blueprint.  ### Step 5: Monitor and Optimize Use Choreo’s monitoring tools to check how your API performs under various load conditions. You can also make adjustments as needed, such as increasing the `x-default-max-requests` value for lower traffic situations or reducing the maximum number of requests when experiencing high volume.  For further assistance or advanced configurations, review the documentation [here](https://docs.choreo.io/api-blueprint-reference.html#rate-limiting).  Remember that setting up proper rate limits is crucial for maintaining the stability and scalability of your APIs.\",\n",

         "How to deploy a webapp?",
         "Deploying a web app on the Choreo platform typically involves several steps, but since I don't have direct access to the Choreo environment, I will guide you through the process assuming it's similar to deploying a web application in any environment. If you need more specifics about Choreo, consider looking into the documentation available there.  ### Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy a Web App  #### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment Make sure your local development environment is ready. You need Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. You can install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Also, make sure you have Git for version control.  ```sh # Install Node.js (latest LTS release) # Open https://nodejs.org/en/ ```  #### 2. Create Your Web App You can use a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write your web application code. Let’s assume your web application is a simple Express.js application. Here are the steps to create one:  ```js // app.js const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;  app.get('/', (req, res) => {     res.send('<h1>Welcome to my Web App!</h1>'); });  app.listen(PORT, () => {     console.log(`App running on port ${PORT}`); }); ```  Install Express.js using npm:  ```sh npm install express ```  Initialize a new Node.js project:  ```sh npm init -y ```  #### 3. Commit Files Commit your changes to your Git repository:  ```sh git init git add . git commit -m \"Add my first web application\" ```  #### 4. Push to a Version Control System If your organization has a centralized source control system, push the code to the repository:  ```sh git push origin master ```  #### 5. Create an API Service (if needed) If your application needs to interact with a backend, you might be setting up an API service too. Create the necessary files, and then you can use Choreo’s API services to set this up. For instance, create an API endpoint like `users`:  ```js // user.js const express = require('express'); const app = express();  app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {     const user = req.body;     res.send({message: 'User created!', user}); });  app.listen(3001, () => {     console.log(`User Service running on port 3001`); }); ```  Again, initialize a Node.js project, commit the changes, push to the repository, and set up your API in Choreo.  #### 6. Connect Services and Consumers Using Choreo’s Dashboard and/or its CLI, connect your web app and API services. Ensure they are communicating securely with each other (using OAuth, JWT tokens, etc.).  #### 7. Deploy to Choreo (Optional Step) To deploy your app to Choreo, you may want to create a choreo-app.json file if you’re using a custom solution or utilize their built-in support for automatic deployments:  ```json {   \"deploy\": {     \"type\": \"auto\"   } } ```  In Choreo Dashboard, go to **Projects**, create or select an existing project, and follow their deployment instructions or connect to your service.  Please note, this example is a generic guide. Detailed instructions depend on the specific needs and configuration required by your web app and Choreo service integration. For further detailed steps and security configurations, please consult the Choreo documentation: <https://www.wso2.com/wso2-choreo-documentation>.",

         "How to resolve \"\"Module not found error\"\" during the deployment of a Python project?",
         "It's important to note that \"Module not found\" errors generally occur when you try to import a module or package that can't be found during the development or deployment process of your Python project. This type of error is more common in development environments than production. Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue during deployment:  ### 1. **Check Project Environment**    - Ensure your development environment matches the production environment. This includes:      - **Python Version**: Verify the Python version used in both environments.      - **Virtual Environments**: Confirm if you are using a virtual environment (e.g., `virtualenv` or `conda`) and that it’s activated in your deployment environment.        Example command to activate a virtual environment in a terminal:    ```sh    source /path/to/venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS    venv\\Scripts\\activate               # On Windows    ```  ### 2. **Inspect Package Installation**    - **Ensure Installation Paths**: The installation directory needs to be added to the PYTHONPATH or similar system variable depending on your deployment method (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).    - **Use a Local Interpreter**: Sometimes, specifying a local interpreter can help avoid dependency conflicts. For example, in `requirements.txt`, you might see something like:      ```sh      python3/dist-packages/my_module/      ```  ### 3. **Dependency Resolution**    - Use the appropriate tools to manage your dependencies. Popular options include `pip` for package installations and `setuptools` and `wheel` for building and installing packages from source.    - Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to create a list of all installed modules.    - Or use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install specified dependencies.     ### 4. **Review Import Syntax**    - Make sure there are no syntax errors or typos when importing modules. Double-check import statements in your Python files. For instance:      ```python      import sys      import mymodule      ```  ### 5. **Environment Variable Issues**    - Sometimes, issues may arise because a required environment variable is not set correctly. Check your application’s configuration or Dockerfile/environment file for any missing variables.  ### 6. **Debugging Specific Issues**    - For specific error messages related to missing imports, consider these debugging steps:      - Run the `setup.py` file (if present in your project) with a verbose mode to ensure proper installation of the required packages.      - Check for specific import failures by commenting out code chunks until the error is narrowed down.  ### 7. **Documentation Review**    - If the error persists, refer back to the documentation of your deployment system or tool (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes YAML, Cloud Formation). It may detail how to set up the required environments or dependencies properly.  Remember that troubleshooting such issues requires detailed inspection of your project files and the specific build process being used. Always refer to the specific documentation related to your deployment strategy for precise instructions.

         "How to add authentication to my service?",
         "Adding authentication to your service in Choreo involves securing your API endpoints and ensuring that only authorized users can access them. Here’s how you can do it:  ### 1. **Select Authentication Mechanism** Choreo supports various methods for authentication, such as OAuth 2.0, API Key, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), etc.  #### For Example Using OAuth 2.0: OAuth 2.0 is one of the most secure authentication methods. Here's a step-by-step guide:  #### Step 1: Define the Scope of Authorization Determine which resources and actions users should have access to, based on their roles. Common scopes include `read`, `write`, `admin`, etc.  #### Step 2: Set Up a Token Endpoint Create an OAuth 2.0 token endpoint where clients can request authorization codes in exchange for tokens, which can then be used to authenticate subsequent requests to your service.  ##### Setting up the token endpoint: - Navigate to your API in Choreo. - Go to \"API Management\" -> \"Security\". - Configure the `Auth Method` (e.g., OAuth 2.0). - Under the Auth Method Configuration, create your OAuth 2.0 configuration, including the grant types and scopes, etc. - Make sure to save any changes to your configuration.  ### 2. **Configure Authentication Scenarios** For different use cases, you might want to configure different scenarios like implicit flow, client credentials flow, resource owner password credentials flow, and authorization code flow.  #### For Implicit Flow Example: - The user grants permission without exchanging an initial request-response cycle.  #### 3. **Grant Permissions and Authorizations** - Allow or deny permissions for each scope defined in your API Management. - If users need to authorize their access, you may set up interactive authorization flows, such as redirect URI to allow user interaction for granting consent.  ### 4. **Implement the Token Validation in Your Service** To ensure that requests to your service are indeed coming from authorized users, validate the access tokens before processing their requests.  #### For Example, validating a token in a Node.js application: ```javascript const { createOAuthClient } = require(\"@wsol/client-oauth\"); const oauthClient = createOAuthClient(\"your_api_id_here\");  function getAccessToken(req) {     // Extract access token from header or body     const { Authorization } = req.headers;     const accessToken = Authorization.replace('Bearer ', '');     return oauthClient.verifyToken(accessToken); }  async function verifyUserRequest(req, res) {     const validUser = await getAccessToken(req);          if (validUser) {         // User is authenticated, proceed with handling the request     } else {         // Return unauthorized response     } } ```  ### 5. **Test Authentication** Ensure your implementation works as expected with different scenarios and user interactions.  By following these steps, you can add robust authentication mechanisms to protect your services in Choreo.  **Additional Resources:** - [Creating and Managing API Credentials](https://docs.choreo.io/developers/creating-and-managing-api-credentials/) - [Setting Up an OAuth 2.0 API Management Scenario](https://docs.choreo.io/developers/setting-up-an-oauth-20-api-management-scenario/)  Refer to the official Choreo documentation for more detailed and up-to-date guidance.",

         "How to add a custom domain to my web app?",
         "It seems like there might be a misunderstanding; Choreo is more about integration and building iPaaS solutions rather than providing domain registration or web hosting services. However, I can guide you on how to manage domains if you are using another platform associated with your application.  For Choreo, which is an iPaaS service from WSO2, you usually don't have direct control over adding custom domains to your web app since it’s not designed for web app deployment but for service integration. For service integrations and API management, the custom domain setting would typically be part of configuring the backend services that integrate with your Choreo account.  If you have an API Gateway set up and want to use custom domains, you might need to configure the backend services or check with your service provider if they support this feature. Here’s a general overview if your setup involves an API Gateway:  1. **Configure Backend Services:** Ensure your backend services or microservices have the appropriate configurations for handling incoming traffic through custom domains.  2. **API Gateway Configuration:** In your Choreo dashboard, navigate to the section related to API Gateways and add a new endpoint if needed.  3. **Custom Domain Setup:** You would need to configure custom domains for the API Gateway in your service provider's portal. This process may involve creating A or CNAME records on DNS providers depending on what your service provider supports.  4. **Route Traffic:** Configure routing rules within the API Gateway to direct traffic based on your custom domains.  However, Choreo does not natively handle the registration of custom domains or the configuration necessary for most web apps. You might need to integrate third-party services or tools for managing domain names if that's necessary for your web application.  For more detailed steps specific to your use case, please check the official Choreo documentation or contact their customer support directly.",

         "How can I add environment variables to python webapp?",
         "Adding environment variables to a Python web application involves configuring your application to read values from an environment instead of hardcoding them into the source code. This method helps manage sensitive information like API keys, database connection strings, and more securely and effectively. Below are some steps to add environment variables in a typical Python web application using a configuration file.  ### Step 1: Create an Environment Variables Configuration File First, create a configuration file where you will store your environment variables. This file typically includes variable names (keys) followed by their corresponding values (values). Here's an example:  ```python # .env.example # Place this file in your project's root directory or any other location accessible to your application. # Use this to store your environment variables.  DB_USER=yourdbuser DB_PASS=yourdbpass SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey ```  ### Step 2: Load Environment Variables into Your Application  #### Using a Module (`env.py`): You can use a Python module named `env.py` to load environment variables from the `.env` file.   Create a new file named `env.py` in your project’s root directory and use this script to read and import environment variables:  ```python # env.py import os  class EnvConfig:     def __init__(self):         self.DB_USER = os.getenv('DB_USER', 'defaultuser')         self.DB_PASS = os.getenv('DB_PASS', 'defaultpassword')         self.SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'defaulthash')  # In your main app.py or wherever your main configuration is set up: from env import EnvConfig  config = EnvConfig() ```  You can then use the configuration class `EnvConfig()` to retrieve these values wherever needed.  #### Alternatively, Modify Settings Directly: If you prefer not to create a dedicated config class, you could directly modify settings based on environment variables. For example:  ```python from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash  # Or use from your actual password manager  # In your app initialization: from flask import Flask import os  app = Flask(__name__)  if app.config.get('ENV') == 'development':     app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///dev.db' elif app.config.get('ENV') == 'production':     app.config.from_object('prod_config.ProductionConfig') else:     raise ValueError(\"Invalid ENV configuration value.\")  app.config['DB_USER'] = os.getenv('DB_USER', 'defaultuser') app.config['DB_PASS'] = os.getenv('DB_PASS', 'defaultpassword') app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'defaulthash')  app.secret_key = generate_password_hash(app.config['SECRET_KEY']) ```  In this case, make sure your application can find `flaskapp/config/prod_config.py`.  ### Step 3: Ensure Web Server or Runtime Environments Support Loading Environment Variables  - **Docker:** If running on Docker, ensure your image has access to environment variables and they are available at runtime.    - **Web Servers:** Depending on your web server or runtime environment, it might support loading environment variables via a `.env` file or an environment-specific script. Consult the documentation of the environment you are running the app on for more details.  ### Optional: Managing Environment Variable Changes You can update `.env` files without having to restart services. If using Docker, you may need to reload configurations depending on the runtime environment.  Remember, the `.env` file and the methods mentioned here should be stored safely in your repository and managed as part of your deployment process.  For further customization or advanced requirements, consult the documentation of a specific library, framework, or runtime you're working with to learn how best to implement environment variables in your setup.",
         "To set up environment variables in **Choreo**, follow these steps:\n\n**Steps to Apply Environment Variables**\n\n1. **Navigate to Your Component in Choreo Console**:\n - Go to the **Component Listing** pane and click on the component you want to configure.\n\n2. Access **Configurations & Secrets**:\n - In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Configs & Secrets**.\n\n3. **Create a New Environment Variable**:\n - Click **+ Create**.\n - In the **Create a Config or Secret** pane, select **Environment Variables**.\n\n4. **Mark as a Secret (Optional)**:\n - If you need the environment variable values to be secrets, select **Mark as a Secret**. Note that you will not be able to read these values after setting them.\n\n5. **Specify the Environment Variables**:\n - Enter the **Display Name** for your configuration or secret.\n - Under **Add Environment Variables**, specify the environment variables as **key-value pairs**.\n - Click **Add Item** to add more variables if needed.\n\n6. **Finalize Creation**:\n - Click **Create** to save your environment variables.\n\n**Additional Tips**\n\n- **Ballerina Configurables**: If you are dealing with Ballerina components, you can manage configurables separately. Configurables can be used instead of environment variables for file mounts in Ballerina components. \n\n**Security Note**\n\n- All configurations and secrets are stored in an encrypted secret vault managed by **WSO2** in the cloud data plane. If you are on a private data plane, they are stored in an **Azure key vault** or **AWS secret manager** attached to your data plane in your cloud environment.",

         "How to connect the React frontend to the backend?",
         "Connecting a React frontend to the backend depends on several factors such as the technology stack you are using, the API design, and security requirements. However, here’s a basic guide on how to integrate a simple RESTful backend with a React frontend:  ### Step 1: Create Your Backend Service For this example, we will use Node.js and Express as the backend framework along with a fictional API.  #### Install Necessary Packages ```bash npm install express axios body-parser ```  #### Create Backend App ```javascript // server.js (backend) const express = require('express'); const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); const app = express(); app.use(bodyParser.json());  app.post('/api/register', (req, res) => {   const { name } = req.body;   // Here, process data and send back response   res.status(200).json({ message: 'User registered' }); });  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;  app.listen(PORT, () => {   console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`); }); ```  #### Running Your Backend Run your backend with the following command: ```bash node server.js ``` You can access it at `http://localhost:3000/api/register`.  ### Step 2: Create Your Frontend Using React Now, create a simple React component to call this API endpoint.  ```jsx // components/Register.js import React, { useState } from 'react'; import axios from 'axios';  const Register = ({ onSuccess }) => {   const [name, setName] = useState('');    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {     e.preventDefault();      try {       await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/register', { name });        onSuccess && onSuccess();     } catch (error) {       console.error('Error:', error);     }   };    return (     <form onSubmit={\\handleSubmit}>       <label htmlFor=\"name\">Name:</label>       <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />       <button type=\"submit\">Register</button>     </form>   ); };  export default Register; ```  ### Step 3: Run Both Backend & Frontend  Make sure you have both your backend and frontend running simultaneously.  1. Keep one terminal window open with your backend running and another one open to start your React app.  2. Use Webpack Dev Server for both parts:    - For Backend (`server.js`):      ```bash      node_modules/.bin/webpack serve --config ./webpack.config.js --open      ```     - For Frontend (`components/Register.js`):      First, make sure your React app has started, then open the same directory in a new terminal and run:      ```bash      npm run serve      ```     - Note that when you open multiple terminals, ensure your local server is accessible from the React client side.  ### Additional Considerations: 1. **Cross-Origin Requests**: If your frontend and backend are served from different origins (e.g., your React build folder on localhost), you might need to set up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) on your backend. For development, this could be handled in your development environment.  2. **Security**: For real-world applications, add validation to handle incorrect user input, errors, etc. Also, consider adding encryption for sensitive information (like passwords) via HTTPS and security practices (like rate limiting, session management, and error handling).  Remember to review the official Choreo documentation and best practices to optimize performance and security for production-level applications.",

         "How can I implement testing for a full-stack application including automated testing for both frontend and backend components?",
         "To implement testing for a full-stack application, including both frontend and backend components, it's essential to cover different types of tests to ensure high-quality software. Below are some steps you can follow to create automated tests:  ### 1. Backend Testing For the backend, you will want to test the following areas:  #### End-to-End (E2E) Tests - **Test Cases**: These verify entire application flows from user initiation to final result. This helps to ensure that the interaction between frontend and backend components works correctly. - **Test Tools**: You can use tools like Selenium, Katalon Studio, Postman, etc., which can simulate the interaction between your frontend UI and your backend REST APIs.    #### Unit Tests - **Unit Tests**: Covering individual methods of backend services. They are used to verify that each function in your backend code does its job without bugs. - **Test Frameworks**: You might use frameworks like Jest, JUnit, or even the built-in Node.js `mocha` and `chai` along with `supertest` for Node.js backend tests.  #### Integration Tests - **Test Cases**: Tests that check whether different backend services interact as expected. - **Testing Tools**: Tools like JMeter or Postman for HTTP requests and responses, as well as specialized integration testing frameworks like JUnit, which has support for database connections through Spring’s Junit configuration or similar frameworks.  ### 2. Frontend Testing For the frontend, you need to handle different scenarios as well:  #### E2E (End-to-End) Tests - **Browser Automation Tools**: These include Puppeteer, Cypress, Playwright. - **Test Scripts**: Write scripts to emulate user actions (like clicking buttons, typing in forms) and validate the results to match expected output. - **Stress Testing**: Use tools to simulate load and performance testing.  #### Unit Tests - **Jest**: A popular choice for unit testing frontend JavaScript, Vue, and Angular applications. It integrates well with other frameworks like React. - **Code Splitting**: Use Babel, Webpack, or other tools to optimize your test setup and make your application smaller and faster.  #### Mocking - **Mocking Libraries**: Tools like Axios or sinon are very useful for mocking backend API calls.    ### 3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Use tools to integrate testing and deployment:  - **Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, Travis CI, GitLab CI** - Implement pipelines with build, tests, and deployment stages to automate testing and ensure that your application is tested before it is deployed.  ### Best Practices  1. **Use Version Control Systems**: Use Git with branch-based workflow for testing different versions of your code.  2. **Automated Reports**: Ensure that test reports generate a summary of test passes, failures, errors, and other metrics for easier tracking and analysis.  3. **Linter Tools**: Integrate linters (like ESLint, JSHint, Prettier) to maintain coding standards across your codebase.  4. **Database Validation**: Write SQL tests for your database operations (using frameworks like Mongoose, Sequelize).  5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up to date and make sure developers know how to run the tests.  Remember that effective testing requires a combination of the above practices, and depending on the complexity and size of your application, you may need to further customize tests and configurations. For more detailed instructions and examples, you can refer to the respective frameworks' official documentation.",

         "I'm getting \"\"procfile not found\"\" error for my python service. How do I resolve this?",
         "The \"procfile not found\" error typically indicates that your application is configured to run using the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or [Supervisor](https://supervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) management system, but it cannot locate the `procfile`. Since you mentioned that you are creating a Python service, the error suggests there might be something wrong with the configuration related to Docker or Supervisor.  Here’s how you can troubleshoot this issue:  ### Steps to Resolve “Procfile Not Found” Error for Your Python Service:  1. **Check your Configuration:**    - Ensure that you have a `Procfile` in the root directory of your project. The `Procfile` should list your container’s command line arguments (e.g., `web: gunicorn your_project.wsgi --timeout 50` for a WSGI application).        ```bash    web: gunicorn your_project.wsgi --timeout 50    ```  2. **Validate Procfile Syntax:**    - Make sure the `Procfile` follows the correct syntax. It should use one word per line with spaces between words.  3. **Verify Deployment Context:**    - If you are using Docker Compose, ensure that `docker-compose.yml` contains the appropriate configuration to start your application (usually under the `services` section). This YAML file should reference your Python app in the way required by Docker Compose.  4. **Check the Deployment Tool Used:**    - Review how your deployment tool (if applicable) handles the configuration of your app. If you are deploying with Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, etc., double-check if these tools expect a `Procfile`.  5. **Use Supervisord Configuration:**    - For supervisord, make sure you have a `supervisord.conf` configuration file with your Python service specified in its `cmd` directive:     ```ini    [program:your_project]    command=/path/to/your_project/wrapper    stdout_logfile = /dev/null    stderr_logfile = /dev/null    numprocs=1    ```     And make sure to create the appropriate `wrapper` script:     ```sh    #!/bin/sh    /path/to/python your_project/app.py    ```  6. **Test Your Application Locally:**    - Ensure that running `gunicorn` (or similar process manager) works locally before attempting to deploy. Use commands like `docker-compose up -d` (for Docker) or `supervisord` command in `supervisord.conf` to bring up your service locally.  ### Additional Tips:  - **Log Analysis:** Always check the logs for any error messages or warnings that can provide more context on why the `Procfile` could not be found.   - **Refer to Documentation:** If none of the above steps work, review the relevant documentation or examples provided by the orchestrator or management system you are using.  If after going through these steps the problem persists, consider reaching out to the community or forums related to your deployment environment.",

         "To resolve the \"not found\" error for the `.choreo/endpoints.yaml` file in the Choreo platform, follow these steps:  1. **Check Configuration File Path**:    - Ensure that the configuration file `endpoints.yaml` exists in the correct directory structure. The file should be located in the appropriate service or application folder. For instance, if it's for a service named `myService`, it should be under `/src/main/services/myService`.  2. **Correct Directory Structure**:    - Make sure the directory path to your `endpoints.yaml` file is set correctly in the `src/main/config` directory. If your project has multiple layers, make sure the path reflects the layer structure, e.g., `/src/main/config/myService/endpoints.yaml`.  3. **Verify YAML Syntax**:    - Open the `endpoints.yaml` file and make sure the syntax is correct according to the Choreo specifications. Check if all required fields and structures are defined properly. This includes, but isn’t limited to, service name, API definitions, endpoint configurations, and more.  4. **Check Workspace Initialization**:    - Sometimes the workspace might not have been initialized or configured correctly. Start by cleaning the workspace (`mvn clean install`) to ensure no leftovers from previous executions affect the current configuration.     5. **Review Project Properties**:    - Make sure there are no typos in the properties files used by the Maven projects. These properties could be referencing the location of `endpoints.yaml`.  6. **Run Choreo Setup Commands**:    - If necessary, rerun the setup commands or scripts that configure the environment for running your application. Ensure the commands are correctly executed from the root of your workspace.  7. **Seek Further Documentation or Support**:    - If after checking all the above, the issue persists, refer to the official Choreo documentation or seek support from the community or support channels provided by the development team.  8. **Consult Code Samples and Examples**:    - Check Choreo code samples and examples to see if there are any examples available that could match the structure of your `endpoints.yaml` configuration.  By ensuring the file is present in the right directory, following a correct directory structure, and reviewing the configuration carefully, you can usually resolve this issue.",

         "Tell me how I can configure a readiness probe?",
         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, you typically do this through your service configuration, especially when setting up Kubernetes services or integrating services with Docker containers. Below is a guide on how to set it up in the context of Docker containers, which is common practice:  1. **Service Configuration:**    If you’re deploying a service as a standalone process using Docker, ensure the readiness probe is included in the container’s start-up process. The command line to run your Docker image can include a `--readiness-probe` flag.     - For Docker Compose, add it like so:    ```yaml    services:      service_name:        # ...other properties...        command: \"--readiness-probe /path/to/command\"    ```     - In a Docker container, specify the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` to handle the probe:    ```sh    CMD [\"/path/to/probe/script.sh\", \"/path/to/match/check\"]    ```    Make sure your script is capable of executing the required checks (e.g., checking the health status or running a command to verify the service is ready).  2. **Command Handling:**    Your Docker entrypoint script or command should periodically check the readiness state and exit based on the status:    - Use `CMD [\"check-service\", \"http://localhost:8080/status\"]`.    - Alternatively, use `/bin/sh -c` with a shell script for more complex logic.     3. **Probe Configuration Script:**    Write a script that can handle your specific health checks:    ```sh    # Check_script.sh    set -e     if $(curl --fail --head http://localhost:8080/service-status | grep -q 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK')    then      echo 'service_is_ready'      exit 0    else      echo 'service_not_ready'      exit 1    fi    ```  4. **Deployment in Choreo:**    Once deployed, make sure your application exposes the necessary endpoints and statuses that the probe script will check. This could be HTTP status codes, internal state, etc.  5. **Observation:**    You need to observe the result from your readiness probe. Depending on your environment and service setup, you may also monitor readiness probes externally using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.  Remember to adjust the URLs, port numbers, and commands according to your application's specific requirements. If you have any doubts about integrating these into your current workflow or need help with troubleshooting, refer back to the Choreo or Kubernetes documentation for more detailed guidance.",
         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to configure readiness probes.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

         "To implement rate limiting on your APIs in Choreo, follow these steps:  ### Step 1: Create an API Blueprint Ensure you have defined your API in Choreo using its API blueprint format. You can find detailed guidelines on how to create API blueprints [here](https://docs.choreo.io/user-guide.html#creating-api-blueprint).  ### Step 2: Enable Rate Limiting in Your API Blueprint 1. In your API blueprint, add the `RateLimiting` feature. For example:    ```yaml    name: my-api    ...    endpoints:      /my-endpoint:        get:          requestMapping:            parameters:              - in: header                name: X-API-Key                description: Unique Key for accessing the endpoint                style: formurlencoded              - in: header                name: X-Rate-Limit-Header                required: false                type: string            responses:              200:                application/json: \\{\\}            operationId: get-my-endpoint          ...          securityDefinitions:            ApiKeySecurity:              type: api_key              in: header              x-choreo-name: X-API-Key              description: Unique Key for accessing the endpoint            RateLimiting:              type: x-rate-limit              in: header              x-choreo-name: X-Rate-Limit-Header              required: false              x-default-max-age: 86400  # Maximum age of the request in seconds (one day)              x-default-max-requests: 500  # Maximum number of requests allowed per client              x-default-burst: 1000  # Maxiumum number of simultaneous requests    ```  ### Step 3: Apply Rate Limiting Configuration Set up the rate limit settings according to your needs. The above example defines: - **Maximum Age:** 86400 seconds (One day) - **Maximum Requests:** 500 per client - **Burst:** 1000 maximum simultaneous requests  ### Step 4: Deploy Your API Blueprint After configuring the rate limit settings, deploy your updated API blueprint.  ### Step 5: Monitor and Optimize Use Choreo’s monitoring tools to check how your API performs under various load conditions. You can also make adjustments as needed, such as increasing the `x-default-max-requests` value for lower traffic situations or reducing the maximum number of requests when experiencing high volume.  For further assistance or advanced configurations, review the documentation [here](https://docs.choreo.io/api-blueprint-reference.html#rate-limiting).

         "Trivy is a tool designed for scanning for vulnerabilities in container images and local Docker images, and it reports issues that may prevent your code from running correctly. The error messages from Trivy typically indicate a specific issue, which might be due to missing dependencies or incorrect configurations. Here’s how you can resolve common Trivy errors:  1. **Missing Dependencies**: These often appear when a package or library is required but is missing from your image. Ensure that all required packages listed in your `Dockerfile` are included, and consider installing them with `RUN apt-get install <package>` for Ubuntu-like systems or `RUN yum install -y <package>` for RHEL/CentOS-based systems.     Example:    ```dockerfile    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget && rm -v /var/lib/apt/lists/*    # Or    RUN yum install -y wget    ```  2. **Incorrect Configuration Files**: If Trivy identifies issues with configuration files (like `/etc/someconfig.conf`), ensure these files are present and correctly set up. For example, you might need to add the missing section or set correct options.  3. **Package Not Available Over APT/MANAGE_REPOS=true**: If your repository setup doesn't include some necessary packages, you can manually add repositories or use tools like `apt-get install -t <arch>` to access older versions.     Example for adding a custom repository:    ```dockerfile    RUN curl https://example.com/repository | apt-get install -y dpkg    ```  4. **Security Updates or Dependency Incompatibility**: Ensure you are using the right versions of your dependencies and that the updates provided by your system's repositories match the ones in your image. Use `apt-get upgrade` or manage your packages directly with `pip`, `npm`, etc., as appropriate.  5. **Permissions Issues**: Ensure that any configuration or data files require the correct ownership or permissions. You can adjust these with commands like:    ```dockerfile    RUN chown -R someuser:somedir /somepath    ```  6. **Network Errors**: Ensure you have a network connection if you're fetching remote dependencies or data. Disable caching if necessary or add `-n` option when executing commands:    ```dockerfile    RUN apt-get install -n wget    ```  7. **Check Trivy Output**: Always review the complete output generated by Trivy, focusing on error lines and their context in the log. This helps pinpoint exactly what dependency or file might be missing.  Referencing the [Charm Documentation](https://charms.com/docs/stable/security/using/) might also be beneficial, depending on the version of Charm and its specific integrations. Always ensure you are checking the latest release notes or support pages for additional guidelines. If stuck, contacting the Charm community forums or Support channels is recommended.

This helps in maintaining your project's parameters without directly hardcoding them into your codebase. Here’s a step-by-step guide:  ### Step 1: Define Your Configuration Variables Create or define the necessary configurations in environment variables or a `config.json` or `config.js` file (if it's JavaScript-based).  ### Step 2: Use .env File for Local Development If this is a local development project, you can use the `.env` file. It is useful for storing environment-specific variables such as database connection URLs, API keys, etc.  #### Example `.env` File: ``` PORT=3000 DB_HOST=localhost DB_USER=root DB_PASSWORD=rootpassword JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey ```  To set environment variables from your `.env` file, you can use tools like `dotenv`. Make sure you install it via npm before initializing your project:  ```bash npm install dotenv ```  In your root directory (`package.json`), configure a script:  ```json \"scripts\": {     \"start\": \"node server.js\",     \"dev\": \"node -r dotenv/config server.js\" }, ```  And create or modify your entry point, `server.js` (for Express): ```javascript require('dotenv').config(); // Load env vars const { PORT } = require('./config'); const app = express(); app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`App running on PORT ${PORT}`)); ```  ### Step 3: Use `.env.local` for Different Environments If you have environment-specific configurations, you can add an extra `.env.local` file. The `.local` file overrides default values defined in `.env`.  ### Step 4: Use Configuration Management Libraries For larger projects, consider using dedicated configuration libraries or modules. For example, using `config`:  #### Example Configuration File (`config/index.js`): ```javascript module.exports = {     PORT: process.env.PORT || 3000,     DB_CONNECTION: {         HOST: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',         USER: process.env.DB_USER || 'root',         PASSWORD: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || 'rootpassword',     },     JWT_SECRET: process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'mysecretkey' }; ```  ### Step 5: Access Configurations Throughout Your Application Now you can easily access these configurations anywhere in your project using `config`.  ### Example Accessing Configuration in Component (`src/components/App.js`):  ```javascript import { config } from './config';  function App() {     const dbConfig = config.db_connection;     return <div>Config: {JSON.stringify(dbConfig)}</div>; }  export default App; ```  This approach keeps your configuration out of your project files and ensures that any changes made in one part of your application reflect the right settings for all instances.  For more detailed instructions, including how to initialize a project if you're new to React, check out the official React documentation on [creating a new React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-react-app.html). Additionally, the official [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_environment) provides insight into managing environment variables in Node.js applications.",
         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it. You can create a config file mount via the Configurations pane on the Deploy page in the Choreo Console.",

         "How can I secure my web app?",
         "Securing your web app involves several important steps to protect your application and its data. Here’s a general guide to securing your web app:  ### Step 1: Choose Strong Security Practices 1. **Authentication**: Implement strong authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure only authorized users access the app.    - Reference: [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/howto-authenticate-users)  ### Step 2: Implement Access Control 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Set up RBAC rules to restrict users from accessing resources they should not be allowed to see.    - Reference: [RBAC Example](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/rbac-example)  ### Step 3: Secure Sensitive Data 1. **Data Masking**: Obfuscate or mask sensitive data in transit and at rest to prevent exposure.    - Reference: [Data Masking](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/data-masking)  ### Step 4: Use HTTPS and SSL/TLS 1. Enable HTTPS and SSL/TLS encryption on all your endpoints. This ensures that data being transmitted between clients and the server is encrypted.    - Reference: [Configure HTTPS/SSL](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/enable-https-tls)  ### Step 5: Regularly Update Dependencies 1. Keep your libraries, dependencies, and software up-to-date with the latest security patches and bug fixes.     - Reference: [Versioning and Upgrading Libraries](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/library-upgrade)  ### Step 6: Regularly Monitor Your Application 1. Implement monitoring and logging to detect suspicious activities and vulnerabilities in real-time.    - Reference: [Logging and Monitoring](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/observability-monitoring-logging)  ### Step 7: Ensure Proper Input Validation 1. Always validate all user input on the backend to avoid common exploits like SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).    - Reference: [Input Validation](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/input-validation)  ### Step 8: Limit Direct Access to Services 1. Minimize the amount of data exposed by implementing appropriate firewall and network segmentation strategies.    - Reference: [Network Segmentation](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/network-segmentation)  ### Step 9: Protect Against Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks 1. Implement DoS protection to shield your web application from malicious attacks designed to disrupt services.    - Reference: [DoS Protection](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/dois-protection)  ### Step 10: Secure Backend Services 1. Securely expose backend services using Choreo's API Gateway and ensuring the correct level of permissions is applied to each service endpoint.    - Reference: [API Gateways](https://docs.choreo.io/docs/api-gateways)  By following these best practices and guidelines, you can significantly improve the security of your web application.  For more specific implementation details within Choreo, check out the following links and follow the instructions accordingly.",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component. Using this method you can secure your web application.",

         "What are the steps to secure an API in Choreo?",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can use different security mechanisms depending on your needs and the complexity of your environment. Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up basic OAuth 2.0 authorization flow for securing an API:  ### Step 1: Configure Security First, enable security for your API.  1. Navigate to the **Integrations** section from your Choreo dashboard. 2. Find and click on the **APIs** or the API you want to secure. 3. In the sidebar menu, go to **Configure Security**.  ### Step 2: Create a Key Manager Next, you need to define how client credentials and access tokens will be managed.  1. Click on **Key Manager** from the Configuration tab. 2. Under the Key Manager page, you'll find options for **Secret Key** and **Token Lifetime**.    - Use secret keys when working with clients that are internal to your system.    - Tokens have a predefined time limit to ensure short-lived access, enhancing security.  ### Step 3: Set Up OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server  OAuth 2.0 allows applications to securely access services.  #### Substep 3a: Define Authentication and Token Endpoint 1. Under the key manager, go to **Settings** > **OAuth 2.0 Settings**. 2. Define the OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint URL if needed. 3. Enter the necessary scopes for which you need authorization.  #### Substep 3b: Grant Permissions to Consumers 1. Define your clients who need access to the API. 2. Specify permissions for each consumer using the **Client ID**.  ### Step 4: Protect API Routes with Security Filters To ensure that only authenticated consumers can call your endpoints, configure security filters in Choreo.  1. From the Configuration page, switch to the **Security Filters** tab. 2. Enable the required filters based on your chosen security mechanism (e.g., API key, JWT, OAuth).  #### Example: Using API Key Filter (as a simple example) 1. In Security Filters, add an API Key Filter by clicking the `Add Filter` button. 2. Specify the filter rules, like:    - **Type**: Select **API Key**    - **Method**: Choose the HTTP Method you are securing (e.g., POST, GET, etc.).    - **Value**: This is where you can input API keys.    - **Pattern**: If you want to validate against a token passed in the request header or query parameter.  ### Step 5: Testing Your API Finally, don’t forget to test your API with sample scripts to confirm the security measures work as expected.  1. Go to the **Testing** tab after enabling it in Configuration settings. 2. Use tools provided to send requests and observe responses.  ### Additional Notes - You might want to leverage additional security measures like implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) if you handle user sessions securely. - Regularly monitor logs for unusual activities related to your secured API to maintain safety and reliability.  For detailed guidance, you may also refer to the official [Choreo documentation](https://docs.choreo.io).",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

         "To set up alerts for your service in Choreo, you can configure either latency alerts or traffic alerts. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do both: Setting Up Traffic Alerts Traffic alerts notify you when the request count of an API exceeds a predefined threshold. This is useful for managing APIs with backend traffic limits or monetized backends that require proactive scaling based on incoming traffic. Ensure you are in the correct organization where you have a project with the API to configure a traffic alert. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click Usage Insights. In the left navigation menu on the Usage Insights page, click Alerts. Click the Environment list and select the required environment. Click Alert Configuration. This opens the Alert Configuration pane. Click the Traffic tab. In the API Name field, select the API for which you want to configure the alert. Only the APIs that you have invoked at least once are listed here. For other APIs, you need to give the API name in the required format as instructed in the UI. In the Metric field, select the required metric against which you want to evaluate the alert configuration. In the Threshold field, specify the threshold number of requests per minute. If required, specify the list of emails that should be notified when the alert is generated in the Emails field. Click Add. Once an alert is successfully added, the alert configuration is listed in the Alert Configuration pane. Each configuration can be edited and removed via this pane. Setting Up Latency Alerts Latency alerts notify you if the response latency of an API exceeds a predefined threshold. This is useful for APIs that need to meet specific SLAs and for proactively identifying slow APIs. Ensure you are in the correct organization where you have a project with the API to configure a latency alert. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click Usage Insights. In the left navigation menu on the Usage Insights page, click Alerts. Click the Environment list and select the required environment. Click Alert Configuration. This opens the Alert Configuration pane with the Latency tab open by default. In the API Name field, select the API for which you want to configure the alert.

         "How do I set up automatic scaling for my applications?",
         "It seems there might be some confusion; \"Automatic Scaling\" isn't a native Choreo feature, but I can guide you on how it typically works using Choreo's services along with external tools like AWS (Amazon Web Services). Below is a general guide on setting up automatic scaling in conjunction with Choreo:  ### 1. **Deploy Your Application Using Choreo**    - If your application isn’t already deployed via Choreo, you'll first need to deploy it as a service. For detailed steps, refer to the [Choreo Platform Deployment Guide](https://docs.choreo.platform/docs/deploy-services/) or [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.choreo.platform/docs/getting-started/).  ### 2. **Set Up Auto-scaling Outside Choreo (E.g., AWS Lambda or API Gateway)**    Since Choreo doesn’t natively support auto-scaling, you may use external services such as AWS to automatically scale your application.  #### Example: Using AWS Lambda & API Gateway for Scaling  ##### 2.1. **Setting Up AWS Lambda Function**     - Define a Lambda function to handle incoming requests from API Gateway.      ##### 2.2. **Create AWS API Gateway**     - Use the API Gateway service to create a REST API.      - Configure the API to use the AWS Lambda trigger, ensuring that you define your Lambda functions that act as the entry points for scaling events.      ##### 2.3. **Scaling Logic in Lambda Function**     - The logic to handle the auto-scaling should be implemented within your Lambda function. You can read event details and make API calls (like to DynamoDB for capacity check, etc.) to decide whether scaling actions should occur.  ##### 2.4. **AWS CloudWatch Events**     - Set up CloudWatch events that trigger Lambda functions based on thresholds or custom logic.  ### Steps Summary: 1. **Deploy Application**: Deploy your service via Choreo according to their guidelines. 2. **Create AWS Service**:     - Create Lambda Function     - Configure API Gateway with the Lambda Function     - Implement auto-scaling logic in Lambda 3. **Use External Tools**:     - AWS CloudWatch for monitoring     - AWS API Gateway for REST requests handling     - Ensure your Lambda handles auto-scaling based on defined metrics  ### Documentation Links - **Deployment of Services**: https://docs.choreo.platform/docs/deploy-services/ - **Setting Up API Gateway**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-api.html - **Scaling AWS Lambda**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/scaling.html - **CloudWatch Events**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/Cheatsheet.html  If you need more specific assistance or have any part unclear, please specify!",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "I want to control traffic coming to my API.",
         "To control traffic to your API within Choreo, you have a few options depending on your needs, such as managing the rate limit of your API calls and handling the volume of incoming requests efficiently. Here are some steps to manage traffic:  ### 1. Configure Rate Limiting Choreo provides mechanisms for limiting how often certain types of messages (or events, like webhook requests) can be sent or processed.  #### Steps for Setting Up Rate Limiting:  - **Go to the Choreo Console**: Log into the Choreo Console and go to the \"Monitor\" section, or head straight to the \"Services & Integrations\" page if it's already there.    - **Configure Rate Limiting Policy**:   - If you’re using the Choreo Management API, navigate to `RateLimit` settings under your service. Here, you can create and configure a rate limiting policy. This allows you to specify limits for the number of messages that can be sent per time interval (for instance, per hour).  - **Save Changes**: Once you’ve configured your rate limiting policy, make sure to save your settings.  ### 2. Handling Large Amounts of Incoming Requests If you anticipate a large influx of requests that might overload your service, consider setting up additional controls like back-end throttling.  #### Steps for Back-End Throttling: - **Set Up Middleware in Your Backend**:   - Use a backend library (like Node.js, Python, etc.) to set up middleware or filters that automatically manage incoming requests according to the defined policies. This is a more advanced topic and depends on your application framework.  For example, in Node.js, you could set up request quotas or implement rate-limit middleware.  ### 3. Implementing Webhooks Rate Limits Webhooks in Choreo allow you to handle external consumer requests, which can sometimes pose scalability challenges.  #### Example for Using Rate Limiting for Webhooks: - **Rate Limiting Middleware**: Use a middleware that implements rate limiting logic for each webhook subscription, so you can control how frequently a consumer can call your webhook endpoint.  Here’s a simplified example of how to achieve this using Express in Node.js: ```javascript const express = require('express'); const { createThrottleMiddleware } = require('express-throttle');  const app = express(); const rateLimitOptions = {     throttleLimit: 500000, // 500 requests per second (per client)     maxRequestsPerSecond: 50, };  // Define the throttling middleware for your API app.use(createThrottleMiddleware(rateLimitOptions, '/yourapiendpoint'));  app.post('/yourapiendpoint', async (req, res) => {     console.log(req.throttleInfo.rate); // Logs the rate information if exceeded     res.json({ message: 'Webhook received successfully' }); });  app.listen(3000, () => {     console.log('Server running on port 3000'); }); ```  - **Install Required Libraries**:   ```shell   npm install express-throttle   ```  This guide should help you get started with configuring traffic control for your API in Choreo. For a more detailed implementation and specific to Choreo’s setup, consider referring to the [Choreo Management API Documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AMR630/Managing+API+Traffic).

         "My build fails during trivy scan",
         "It seems like you encountered a failure while running the `trivy` command for a package security check, likely during your build process. Before we delve into potential solutions, I'll provide some steps and best practices for running the `trivy` scan:  ### Basic Steps  1. **Install `trivy`:**    Make sure `trivy` is installed in your environment. You can use the following command to install it via `pip`:    ```sh    pip install trivy    ```  2. **Running Trivy Scan:**    To perform a package security check, run the `trivy` command from the root directory of your project, where all your packages are stored. This ensures that all dependencies are properly analyzed.     Here’s an example command:    ```sh    trivy io.json    ```    - This command will scan `json` files for any vulnerabilities in the specified dependencies.  ### Common Issues and Troubleshooting  If the scan still fails, here are some common causes and how to troubleshoot them:  #### 1. Incorrect `trivy` Configuration: Verify the `trivy` configuration settings: - If the issue persists, double-check the paths and settings in the command line. - Ensure `trivy` has access to all required files.  #### 2. Permission Issues: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read files in the directory.  #### 3. Environment Variable Issues: Sometimes environment variables may affect `trivy`’s behavior: - For example, setting a specific cache directory using the `TRIVY_CACHE_DIR` environment variable might be required:   ```sh   export TRIVY_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache   trivy io.json   ```  #### 4. Package Management System Issues: If you’re using a package manager (like `pip`, `npm`, etc.), make sure you’ve updated the metadata: - For `pip` dependencies:   ```sh   pip install --upgrade pip   pip cache cleanup   pip list   ``` - For `npm` dependencies:   ```sh   npm ci   npm audit fix   ```  ### External Tools or Custom Scanners  If basic `trivy` scanning isn’t meeting your needs, consider integrating custom vulnerability scanners: - Use tools that offer more advanced vulnerability detection (like OWASP ZAP, OpenVAS). - Consider running multiple security scans with different tools for comprehensive analysis.  If you provide more details or code samples, I can give more targeted advice. Please also refer to the [Choreo documentation](https://docs.choreo.io/) for integration-specific security checks if needed.",

         "I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely?",
         "Securing secret keys such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or other sensitive information is crucial for maintaining the security of your applications. Here’s how you can securely manage these secrets for a React web application:  ### 1. Environment Variables The most common and secure way to manage secrets is through environment variables. This method allows you to separate sensitive information from your codebase.  #### Step-by-Step Guide Using `dotenv` Library 1. **Install dotenv:**    First, install the dotenv package if it’s not already included in your project.    ```bash    npm install dotenv    ``` 2. **Configure Environment Variables:**    Create or add the necessary `.env` file in the root directory of your project with your secret configurations, e.g.,     ```env    SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey    PORT=3000    ``` 3. **Load Environment Variables:**    Modify your main entry point (e.g., `index.js`, `app.js`) to load environment variables from the `.env` file.    ```js    require('dotenv').config();     const SECRET_KEY = process.env.SECRET_KEY;    const PORT = process.env.PORT;     // Use your environment variable inside the app logic    const app = express();    ```  ### 2. Secrets Manager Alternatively, you can use a secrets manager tool like AWS Secrets Manager or Vault for managing your secret keys.  #### Using AWS Secrets Manager Example (CLI) 1. **Register and Setup:**    - Enable the AWS SDK and setup a configuration file for CLI to authenticate. 2. **Deploy Secret Key:**    Deploy the secret key to the secret manager. 3. **Retrieve Secret:**    Access the secret key in your application using the secret manager tool.  ### 3. Service Discovery and Authentication (JWTs etc.) If your application involves authentication, you could use JWTs to handle authentication rather than relying on static secrets. JWTs include claims that allow client-side access controls.  #### Example (Node.js and Passport): 1. **Install required packages:**    ```bash    npm install passport passport-http-jwt    ```  2. **Set Up Configuration in Your Server Code:**    ```js    const JwtStrategy = require('passport-http-jwt').Strategy;    const ExtractJwt = require('passport-http-jwt').ExtractJwt;     const options = {        secretOrKey: process.env.JWT_SECRET,        algorithms: ['HS256'],    };     passport.use(new JwtStrategy(options, async function (jwtSecret, jwtData, done) {        if (jwtData) {            return done(null, jwtData);        } else {            return done(null, false);        }    }));     app.use(passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false }), function(req, res, next) {        // Authorized routes here        next();    });    ```  ### Recommendations - Always avoid hardcoding secrets directly into your application code. - Consider encrypting secrets before storing them and decrypt them at runtime for better security practices. - Use HTTPS and regularly update and audit your security settings.  ### Documentation Links - [Choreo API Management](https://docs.choreo.io/) - For any Choreo related secrets management within the platform. - [npm Package Installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) - General guidance on how to install dependencies, including `dotenv`. - [AWS Secrets Manager Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/welcome.html) - Official documentation for using AWS Secrets Manager.

         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it.

         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

         "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?",
         "In Choreo, there are several ways to protect an API to enhance security and privacy. Here are some methods:  1. **Authentication**:    - **OAuth**: Use OAuth tokens to authorize access. This method requires both client credentials and user credentials (access token) for authorization and token generation. Choreo supports various types of authentication including OAuth 2.0.     2. **Authorization**:    - Implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication ensures that even if an API endpoint is intercepted, attackers would not be able to consume unauthorized data.    - Configure authorization rules and scopes based on the needs of your API.  3. **Firewall Rules**:    - You can define rules to control the traffic flow and block unauthorized or malicious connections to the API endpoints.  4. **Rate Limiting**:    - To protect your API from overload, set up rate limiting rules to limit the number of requests an API consumer can make within a certain time frame.  5. **HTTPS/SSL**:    - Ensure your API is served over HTTPS to secure data during transmission and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.  6. **API Keys**:    - Generate and use API keys to authenticate API consumers, allowing only those with valid keys to call the API. API key management should also include secure key rotation and handling.  7. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:    - Allow only specific domains to request resources from your server. This can help prevent cross-origin attacks and XSS.  8. **API Management Features**:    - Choreo includes advanced API management tools that enable granular control over what resources are exposed through which endpoints. These features can restrict access to API resources and enforce specific access policies.  9. **Monitoring and Logging**:    - Enable monitoring and logging to track API usage and identify potential security incidents. This helps you quickly react to any security threats.  For detailed instructions on how to implement these features, you may want to refer to the official Choreo documentation, particularly the sections on Authentication and Security.",

This is usually done in the \"User Roles\" section.    - When you update user roles to mark users as administrators, this also configures the visibility settings.  5. **Verify Access Control**:    - After making the changes, log out and back in, or refresh your current session. Only authenticated admin users will have access to see and interact with the restricted APIs.  Here's some more detail on the steps above, with links to specific areas in the Choreo UI:  - For creating a role:    - Click on the “Roles & Permissions” section and click on the “Edit Roles & Permissions” button, then define and save roles.  - For assigning the role to users:   - Navigate to the User Management page, edit the user's role, and select the appropriate administrator role from the dropdown.  If you need more detailed steps on navigating to specific sections, you can refer to the [official Choreo documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CHOREO), where you can find step-by-step guides for different parts of the Choreo system.",
         "To restrict API visibility to admin users in an organization using Choreo, follow these steps: Step-by-Step Guide Navigate to the API Info Page: In the Choreo Console, go to the Component Listing pane and select the REST API (Service) for which you want to control visibility.

         "How do I get started with using Choreo CLI on my computer?",
         "To start using the Choreo Command Line Interface (CLI) on your computer, follow these steps:  1. **Install Java**:    - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher installed on your system. The CLI requires Java for its execution.    - To check your Java version:      ```bash      java -version      ```    - If necessary, install JDK 8 or later from the Oracle website or open source alternatives like OpenJDK.  2. **Add Choreo to PATH**:    - After installing JDK, download the Choreo CLI distribution file (`.tar.gz`) from the official Choreo website or the WSO2 Maven repository if you have the Maven environment set up.    - Unzip the downloaded `.tar.gz` file and navigate to the Choreo CLI directory in your terminal.    - To add the Choreo CLI directory to your system's PATH variable, follow these steps for your respective operating systems:       - For **Windows**:        - Locate the path of the choreo directory. Typically, it’s located inside `choreo-x.y.z-win64` (where `x.y.z` is your version number).        - Add the following line to your Windows Environment Variable:          ```cmd          set PATH=%PATH%;%choreo_home%\\bin          ```        - Replace `%\\choreo_home%` with the actual directory location. Open the `Environment Variables` in System Properties and modify the PATH accordingly.       - For **macOS/Linux**:        - First, open Terminal.        - Create a symbolic link or manually copy the Choreo CLI scripts into your local shell startup file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) depending on your shell type:          ```bash          ln -s /path/to/choreo/home/bin choreo          ```          - Where `/path/to/choreo/home` is the root path where you extracted the Choreo distribution.          - Alternatively, you can manually add a new command by appending the Choreo CLI binary (`./bin/choreo`) to your local shell startup file:            ```bash            echo \"export PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/Path_To_your_choreo/home/bin\";\" >> ~/.zshrc            ```       - After making changes to the PATH:        ```bash        source ~/.zshrc  # For Zsh        source ~/.bashrc # For Bash        ```  3. **Check if the CLI is correctly installed**:    - Navigate back to a shell terminal window where PATH was added.    - Type `choreo` and press Enter to verify if the CLI is working correctly.    - Expected Output:      ```      Usage:      choreo [command] [command options]      For detailed usage information on a command use:      choreo [command] --help      Examples:      choreo api create      choreo app create      choreo login      ...      ```  By successfully completing these steps, you should now be able to run Choreo CLI commands in your system.",
         "To use Choreo CLI locally, follow these steps: Installing Choreo CLI Download and Install: You can install the Choreo CLI by running the following command in your terminal: curl -o- https://cli.choreo.dev/install.sh | bash Update Choreo CLI: If you already have the CLI installed and want to update it, you can use the same command: curl -o- https://cli.choreo.dev/install.sh | bash Using Choreo CLI The Choreo CLI supports various component types such as Service, Web Application, Webhook, Scheduled Task, and Manual Task. Here are some common commands you might find useful: Getting Help: To get help with a specific command, use: choreo <command> --help Creating a Component: You can create a component with specific build configurations using: choreo create component <name> --project <name> --build-configs='key1=value1,key2=value2' Build Configurations Depending on the type of component you are creating, you might need specific build configurations.

         "How do I configure my applications to scale automatically?",
         "To configure your applications in Choreo to scale automatically, you typically leverage automatic scaling services which are often enabled through cloud platforms or auto-scaling policies configured within your Choreo setup. However, in Choreo, this usually involves defining scaling policies for your microservices and integrating them with a cloud provider's auto-scaling service (like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Run, etc.) which can then trigger auto-scaling actions based on predefined conditions like CPU usage, memory consumption, etc.  Here’s a general guideline on how you might set up scaling within Choreo:  1. **Microservice Configuration**:    - Define your microservices in Choreo with proper configurations including the environment-specific settings (local testing, development, staging, production) that can vary in terms of memory size, CPU requirements, etc.     2. **Scaling Policies**:    - Define scaling policies within Choreo that trigger when certain conditions are met (e.g., CPU utilization above a certain level). This helps in dynamically allocating resources based on actual resource usage.  3. **Integration with Auto-Scaling Service**:    - Configure Choreo to be integrated with an auto-scaling service of your choice. For example, if using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Choreo can use metrics from AWS and autoscale the deployment based on those metrics.  4. **Cloud Provider Management Console**:    - Manage these settings through your cloud provider’s management console, following best practices for configuring autoscaling rules, thresholds, and cooldown periods to avoid rapid scaling that could overwhelm resources.  5. **Choreo Integration Settings**:    - In Choreo, navigate to the \"Settings\" or \"Integrations\" section, depending on the version of Choreo, and find settings related to scaling configurations. These may include selecting which metrics to monitor and what action to take (increase or decrease the number of instances).  6. **Testing and Monitoring**:    - Before deploying a microservice that will handle scaled-up traffic, perform extensive testing in your dev or test environment to ensure everything works as expected during automatic scaling scenarios.  For more detailed steps, you might refer to the Choreo user manual or the specific auto-scaling services documentation provided by your cloud provider.",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "My service gets overloaded with requests how to fix this?",
         "If your service is experiencing overload with too many requests, here are some steps you can take to address the issue:  1. **Load Balancing**:    - Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of your service to spread the load. This can be achieved by configuring load balancers. Refer to [Choreo's documentation on Load Balancers](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CL/Predetermined+Load+Balancer).  2. **Caching Mechanisms**:    - Implement caching strategies to store results of expensive operations, thereby reducing the number of requests that reach the backend service. You can use a distributed cache solution or a dedicated caching service. Consult the [Choreo Caching](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CHOREO910/Caching) guide for more details.  3. **Throttling**:    - Set up rate limiting and throttling policies to manage the request volume. You can configure these settings in Choreo through its policy editor. Look at [Throttling](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AMR14/Throttle+a+Service#Throttleaservice-PolicyManagement).  4. **Service Health Checks and Failover**:    - Ensure that your service is designed to handle failures and perform failover to other instances automatically. Choreo supports automatic scaling which can also mitigate load spikes. Review the [Choreo Service Failover](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CL/Service+Failover) documentation.  5. **Optimize Performance and Response Times**:    - Review performance bottlenecks and optimize your service code and API design. Use Choreo’s tools to monitor your service’s performance and make necessary adjustments.  6. **Queue Management**:    - If applicable, set up message queues between your consumer applications and your service to decouple them. This can provide a queue for handling high request loads and managing concurrency. The documentation on [Queues](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EIaddon-GettingstartedwithMessages) might be useful.  7. **Implement Retry and Error Handling**:    - Ensure that your application can retry failed requests and manage error messages appropriately. This helps in gracefully handling temporary failures. Refer to [Retry and Fault Tolerance](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EIDG/Retry-and-Fault-Tolerance) for detailed instructions.  By following these steps, you can effectively manage and distribute the load on your Choreo service. If problems persist, consider reaching out to the Choreo support team for more specialized assistance.",
         "Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon. Expand the Rate Limiting section under Manage. Select a Rate Limiting Level and click Apply. Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count. For API Proxy components, the process differs slightly. After step 2, click the settings icon next to API Configuration and proceed directly to selecting the Rate Limiting Level.",

    "\"Deploying a web app on the Choreo platform typically involves several steps, but since I don't have direct access to the Choreo environment, I will guide you through the process assuming it's similar to deploying a web application in any environment. If you need more specifics about Choreo, consider looking into the documentation available there.  ### Step-by-Step Guide to Deploy a Web App  #### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment Make sure your local development environment is ready. You need Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed. You can install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Also, make sure you have Git for version control.  ```sh # Install Node.js (latest LTS release) # Open https://nodejs.org/en/ ```  #### 2. Create Your Web App You can use a text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write your web application code. Let’s assume your web application is a simple Express.js application. Here are the steps to create one:  ```js // app.js const express = require('express'); const app = express(); const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;  app.get('/', (req, res) => {     res.send('<h1>Welcome to my Web App!</h1>'); });  app.listen(PORT, () => {     console.log(`App running on port ${PORT}`); }); ```  Install Express.js using npm:  ```sh npm install express ```  Initialize a new Node.js project:  ```sh npm init -y ```  #### 3. Commit Files Commit your changes to your Git repository:  ```sh git init git add . git commit -m \\\"Add my first web application\\\" ```  #### 4. Push to a Version Control System If your organization has a centralized source control system, push the code to the repository:  ```sh git push origin master ```  #### 5. Create an API Service (if needed) If your application needs to interact with a backend, you might be setting up an API service too. Create the necessary files, and then you can use Choreo’s API services to set this up. For instance, create an API endpoint like `users`:  ```js // user.js const express = require('express'); const app = express();  app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {     const user = req.body;     res.send({message: 'User created!', user}); });  app.listen(3001, () => {     console.log(`User Service running on port 3001`); }); ```  Again, initialize a Node.js project, commit the changes, push to the repository, and set up your API in Choreo.  #### 6. Connect Services and Consumers Using Choreo’s Dashboard and/or its CLI, connect your web app and API services. Ensure they are communicating securely with each other (using OAuth, JWT tokens, etc.).  #### 7. Deploy to Choreo (Optional Step) To deploy your app to Choreo, you may want to create a choreo-app.json file if you’re using a custom solution or utilize their built-in support for automatic deployments:  ```json {   \\\"deploy\\\": {     \\\"type\\\": \\\"auto\\\"   } } ```  In Choreo Dashboard, go to **Projects**, create or select an existing project, and follow their deployment instructions or connect to your service.  Please note, this example is a generic guide. Detailed instructions depend on the specific needs and configuration required by your web app and Choreo service integration. For further detailed steps and security configurations, please consult the Choreo documentation: <https://www.wso2.com/wso2-choreo-documentation>.\",\n",
    "\"It's important to note that \\\"Module not found\\\" errors generally occur when you try to import a module or package that can't be found during the development or deployment process of your Python project. This type of error is more common in development environments than production. Here are steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue during deployment:  ### 1. **Check Project Environment**    - Ensure your development environment matches the production environment. This includes:      - **Python Version**: Verify the Python version used in both environments.      - **Virtual Environments**: Confirm if you are using a virtual environment (e.g., `virtualenv` or `conda`) and that it’s activated in your deployment environment.        Example command to activate a virtual environment in a terminal:    ```sh    source /path/to/venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS    venv\\Scripts\\\\activate               # On Windows    ```  ### 2. **Inspect Package Installation**    - **Ensure Installation Paths**: The installation directory needs to be added to the PYTHONPATH or similar system variable depending on your deployment method (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, etc.).    - **Use a Local Interpreter**: Sometimes, specifying a local interpreter can help avoid dependency conflicts. For example, in `requirements.txt`, you might see something like:      ```sh      python3/dist-packages/my_module/      ```  ### 3. **Dependency Resolution**    - Use the appropriate tools to manage your dependencies. Popular options include `pip` for package installations and `setuptools` and `wheel` for building and installing packages from source.    - Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to create a list of all installed modules.    - Or use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install specified dependencies.     ### 4. **Review Import Syntax**    - Make sure there are no syntax errors or typos when importing modules. Double-check import statements in your Python files. For instance:      ```python      import sys      import mymodule      ```  ### 5. **Environment Variable Issues**    - Sometimes, issues may arise because a required environment variable is not set correctly. Check your application’s configuration or Dockerfile/environment file for any missing variables.  ### 6. **Debugging Specific Issues**    - For specific error messages related to missing imports, consider these debugging steps:      - Run the `setup.py` file (if present in your project) with a verbose mode to ensure proper installation of the required packages.      - Check for specific import failures by commenting out code chunks until the error is narrowed down.  ### 7. **Documentation Review**    - If the error persists, refer back to the documentation of your deployment system or tool (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes YAML, Cloud Formation). It may detail how to set up the required environments or dependencies properly.  Remember that troubleshooting such issues requires detailed inspection of your project files and the specific build process being used. Always refer to the specific documentation related to your deployment strategy for precise instructions.  If you need help with a particular aspect related to Choreo or related integrations, feel free to ask!\",\n",
    "\"Adding authentication to your service in Choreo involves securing your API endpoints and ensuring that only authorized users can access them. Here’s how you can do it:  ### 1. **Select Authentication Mechanism** Choreo supports various methods for authentication, such as OAuth 2.0, API Key, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), etc.  #### For Example Using OAuth 2.0: OAuth 2.0 is one of the most secure authentication methods. Here's a step-by-step guide:  #### Step 1: Define the Scope of Authorization Determine which resources and actions users should have access to, based on their roles. Common scopes include `read`, `write`, `admin`, etc.  #### Step 2: Set Up a Token Endpoint Create an OAuth 2.0 token endpoint where clients can request authorization codes in exchange for tokens, which can then be used to authenticate subsequent requests to your service.  ##### Setting up the token endpoint: - Navigate to your API in Choreo. - Go to \\\"API Management\\\" -> \\\"Security\\\". - Configure the `Auth Method` (e.g., OAuth 2.0). - Under the Auth Method Configuration, create your OAuth 2.0 configuration, including the grant types and scopes, etc. - Make sure to save any changes to your configuration.  ### 2. **Configure Authentication Scenarios** For different use cases, you might want to configure different scenarios like implicit flow, client credentials flow, resource owner password credentials flow, and authorization code flow.  #### For Implicit Flow Example: - The user grants permission without exchanging an initial request-response cycle.  #### 3. **Grant Permissions and Authorizations** - Allow or deny permissions for each scope defined in your API Management. - If users need to authorize their access, you may set up interactive authorization flows, such as redirect URI to allow user interaction for granting consent.  ### 4. **Implement the Token Validation in Your Service** To ensure that requests to your service are indeed coming from authorized users, validate the access tokens before processing their requests.  #### For Example, validating a token in a Node.js application: ```javascript const { createOAuthClient } = require(\\\"@wsol/client-oauth\\\"); const oauthClient = createOAuthClient(\\\"your_api_id_here\\\");  function getAccessToken(req) {     // Extract access token from header or body     const { Authorization } = req.headers;     const accessToken = Authorization.replace('Bearer ', '');     return oauthClient.verifyToken(accessToken); }  async function verifyUserRequest(req, res) {     const validUser = await getAccessToken(req);          if (validUser) {         // User is authenticated, proceed with handling the request     } else {         // Return unauthorized response     } } ```  ### 5. **Test Authentication** Ensure your implementation works as expected with different scenarios and user interactions.  By following these steps, you can add robust authentication mechanisms to protect your services in Choreo.  **Additional Resources:** - [Creating and Managing API Credentials](https://docs.choreo.io/developers/creating-and-managing-api-credentials/) - [Setting Up an OAuth 2.0 API Management Scenario](https://docs.choreo.io/developers/setting-up-an-oauth-20-api-management-scenario/)  Refer to the official Choreo documentation for more detailed and up-to-date guidance.\",\n",
    "\"It seems like there might be a misunderstanding; Choreo is more about integration and building iPaaS solutions rather than providing domain registration or web hosting services. However, I can guide you on how to manage domains if you are using another platform associated with your application.  For Choreo, which is an iPaaS service from WSO2, you usually don't have direct control over adding custom domains to your web app since it’s not designed for web app deployment but for service integration. For service integrations and API management, the custom domain setting would typically be part of configuring the backend services that integrate with your Choreo account.  If you have an API Gateway set up and want to use custom domains, you might need to configure the backend services or check with your service provider if they support this feature. Here’s a general overview if your setup involves an API Gateway:  1. **Configure Backend Services:** Ensure your backend services or microservices have the appropriate configurations for handling incoming traffic through custom domains.  2. **API Gateway Configuration:** In your Choreo dashboard, navigate to the section related to API Gateways and add a new endpoint if needed.  3. **Custom Domain Setup:** You would need to configure custom domains for the API Gateway in your service provider's portal. This process may involve creating A or CNAME records on DNS providers depending on what your service provider supports.  4. **Route Traffic:** Configure routing rules within the API Gateway to direct traffic based on your custom domains.  However, Choreo does not natively handle the registration of custom domains or the configuration necessary for most web apps. You might need to integrate third-party services or tools for managing domain names if that's necessary for your web application.  For more detailed steps specific to your use case, please check the official Choreo documentation or contact their customer support directly.\",\n",
    "\"Testing your service in Choreo is essential to ensure it works as expected. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:  ### Step 1: Test in the Choreo Dashboard 1. **Log into Your Choreo Dashboard**: Access your Choreo account and go to the Dashboard where you manage your services. 2. **Test the Service Locally**: Choreo has tools for testing your service locally before deploying it. Use these tools for small-scale tests.  ### Step 2: Use External Consumers (Simulated Calls) To test how your service behaves when it's integrated with external consumers, use Choreo’s built-in External Consumers feature.  1. **Navigate to External Consumers**:    - Go to the Choreo Dashboard, then find \\\"External Consumers\\\" in the navigation menu.    - This section allows you to create, view, update, and delete external consumer calls.  2. **Create a New External Consumer Call**:    - Click on the \\\"New External Consumer\\\" button to start.    - Configure the details of the external consumer call, including the service endpoint URL.  3. **Invoke and Test**:    - After configuring the external consumer, you can invoke it.    - See the response from the external consumer call directly within Choreo.  ### Step 3: Deploy Your Service 1. **Deploy to Cloud**:    - Ensure that your service deployment complies with Choreo’s best practices.    - Review any necessary settings in Choreo for cloud deployment.  2. **Monitor Your Service**:    - After deployment, use the Monitoring tool in Choreo to keep track of service performance and health.  ### Step 4: Test Integration (Optional but Recommended) If your service needs to be integrated with another application, perform tests there as well:  1. **Integrate External System**:    - Integrate your Choreo service with an external application.    - Follow the steps for integration as described in Choreo’s documentation.  2. **Verify Communication**:    - Ensure messages or data flow between the two systems as expected.  For more detailed guidance and specific configurations, you may want to consult Choreo’s documentation pages:  - [External Consumers in Choreo](https://docs.choreo.wso2.com/en/latest/administering/ext_consumers/) - [Deploying to Choreo Cloud](https://docs.choreo.wso2.com/en/latest/deploy-and-manage/services/deployments/)  Feel free to explore more resources and support if you encounter any difficulties!\",\n",
    "\"Adding environment variables to a Python web application involves configuring your application to read values from an environment instead of hardcoding them into the source code. This method helps manage sensitive information like API keys, database connection strings, and more securely and effectively. Below are some steps to add environment variables in a typical Python web application using a configuration file.  ### Step 1: Create an Environment Variables Configuration File First, create a configuration file where you will store your environment variables. This file typically includes variable names (keys) followed by their corresponding values (values). Here's an example:  ```python # .env.example # Place this file in your project's root directory or any other location accessible to your application. # Use this to store your environment variables.  DB_USER=yourdbuser DB_PASS=yourdbpass SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey ```  ### Step 2: Load Environment Variables into Your Application  #### Using a Module (`env.py`): You can use a Python module named `env.py` to load environment variables from the `.env` file.   Create a new file named `env.py` in your project’s root directory and use this script to read and import environment variables:  ```python # env.py import os  class EnvConfig:     def __init__(self):         self.DB_USER = os.getenv('DB_USER', 'defaultuser')         self.DB_PASS = os.getenv('DB_PASS', 'defaultpassword')         self.SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'defaulthash')  # In your main app.py or wherever your main configuration is set up: from env import EnvConfig  config = EnvConfig() ```  You can then use the configuration class `EnvConfig()` to retrieve these values wherever needed.  #### Alternatively, Modify Settings Directly: If you prefer not to create a dedicated config class, you could directly modify settings based on environment variables. For example:  ```python from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash  # Or use from your actual password manager  # In your app initialization: from flask import Flask import os  app = Flask(__name__)  if app.config.get('ENV') == 'development':     app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///dev.db' elif app.config.get('ENV') == 'production':     app.config.from_object('prod_config.ProductionConfig') else:     raise ValueError(\\\"Invalid ENV configuration value.\\\")  app.config['DB_USER'] = os.getenv('DB_USER', 'defaultuser') app.config['DB_PASS'] = os.getenv('DB_PASS', 'defaultpassword') app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'defaulthash')  app.secret_key = generate_password_hash(app.config['SECRET_KEY']) ```  In this case, make sure your application can find `flaskapp/config/prod_config.py`.  ### Step 3: Ensure Web Server or Runtime Environments Support Loading Environment Variables  - **Docker:** If running on Docker, ensure your image has access to environment variables and they are available at runtime.    - **Web Servers:** Depending on your web server or runtime environment, it might support loading environment variables via a `.env` file or an environment-specific script. Consult the documentation of the environment you are running the app on for more details.  ### Optional: Managing Environment Variable Changes You can update `.env` files without having to restart services. If using Docker, you may need to reload configurations depending on the runtime environment.  Remember, the `.env` file and the methods mentioned here should be stored safely in your repository and managed as part of your deployment process.  For further customization or advanced requirements, consult the documentation of a specific library, framework, or runtime you're working with to learn how best to implement environment variables in your setup.\",\n",
    "\"Connecting a React frontend to the backend depends on several factors such as the technology stack you are using, the API design, and security requirements. However, here’s a basic guide on how to integrate a simple RESTful backend with a React frontend:  ### Step 1: Create Your Backend Service For this example, we will use Node.js and Express as the backend framework along with a fictional API.  #### Install Necessary Packages ```bash npm install express axios body-parser ```  #### Create Backend App ```javascript // server.js (backend) const express = require('express'); const bodyParser = require('body-parser'); const app = express(); app.use(bodyParser.json());  app.post('/api/register', (req, res) => {   const { name } = req.body;   // Here, process data and send back response   res.status(200).json({ message: 'User registered' }); });  const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;  app.listen(PORT, () => {   console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`); }); ```  #### Running Your Backend Run your backend with the following command: ```bash node server.js ``` You can access it at `http://localhost:3000/api/register`.  ### Step 2: Create Your Frontend Using React Now, create a simple React component to call this API endpoint.  ```jsx // components/Register.js import React, { useState } from 'react'; import axios from 'axios';  const Register = ({ onSuccess }) => {   const [name, setName] = useState('');    const handleSubmit = async (e) => {     e.preventDefault();      try {       await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/register', { name });        onSuccess && onSuccess();     } catch (error) {       console.error('Error:', error);     }   };    return (     <form onSubmit={\\handleSubmit}>       <label htmlFor=\\\"name\\\">Name:</label>       <input type=\\\"text\\\" id=\\\"name\\\" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />       <button type=\\\"submit\\\">Register</button>     </form>   ); };  export default Register; ```  ### Step 3: Run Both Backend & Frontend  Make sure you have both your backend and frontend running simultaneously.  1. Keep one terminal window open with your backend running and another one open to start your React app.  2. Use Webpack Dev Server for both parts:    - For Backend (`server.js`):      ```bash      node_modules/.bin/webpack serve --config ./webpack.config.js --open      ```     - For Frontend (`components/Register.js`):      First, make sure your React app has started, then open the same directory in a new terminal and run:      ```bash      npm run serve      ```     - Note that when you open multiple terminals, ensure your local server is accessible from the React client side.  ### Additional Considerations: 1. **Cross-Origin Requests**: If your frontend and backend are served from different origins (e.g., your React build folder on localhost), you might need to set up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) on your backend. For development, this could be handled in your development environment.  2. **Security**: For real-world applications, add validation to handle incorrect user input, errors, etc. Also, consider adding encryption for sensitive information (like passwords) via HTTPS and security practices (like rate limiting, session management, and error handling).  Remember to review the official Choreo documentation and best practices to optimize performance and security for production-level applications.\",\n",
    "\"To deploy your backend and connect it to your frontend application deployed on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:  ### Step 1: Deploy Backend Assuming you're using Choreo for backend development, follow these general steps:  #### Step 1.1: Setting Up Your Backend Project in Choreo - Open the Choreo environment. - Set up and initialize a new project or connect with your existing project.  #### Step 2: Deployment Steps (General) - After deploying your backend, you need to make sure the API is accessible via a URL. This could be an IP address or domain name.  ### Step 2: Connect Frontend to Backend Now that your frontend application (which is on GitHub Pages) is deployed, you'll integrate it with the backend. Below are detailed steps for doing this:  #### Step 2.1: Obtain API Endpoints - Make sure your backend API endpoint is correctly set up. - Use a tool like Postman or cURL to test and retrieve the endpoint URLs.  #### Step 2.2: Set Up Your Frontend to Access Backend API - Open your GitHub repository for the frontend project and locate your `src` or `assets` directory. - Modify the configuration in your JavaScript file(s) to fetch the API. For example, use a function like this:  ```javascript // Example function to fetch data from backend async function fetchData() {     try {         const res = await fetch('https://your-backend-api-endpoint.com/api/data');         const data = await res.json();         console.log(data);         // Here, use data however needed for your app.     } catch (error) {         console.error('Error fetching data:', error);     } } ```  - Ensure your code can handle responses (e.g., using `.then()` for handling success and `.catch()` for errors).  #### Step 2.3: Testing - Test the connection and interaction between your frontend and backend using local development tools like DevTools and a local backend server if necessary.  ### Step 3: Continuous Integration / Deployment - Set up continuous deployment from Git to your backend and frontend repositories if required. - Consider setting up continuous deployment pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab, CircleCI, or GH Actions if you’re integrating with GitHub Actions.  By following these steps, your frontend application deployed in GitHub Pages should be able to connect seamlessly to your backend service. Always ensure secure and stable connections, especially in production environments.  For specific Choreo API integrations or backend configurations, refer directly to the official Choreo documentation or seek support from their community forums.\",\n",
    "\"To implement testing for a full-stack application, including both frontend and backend components, it's essential to cover different types of tests to ensure high-quality software. Below are some steps you can follow to create automated tests:  ### 1. Backend Testing For the backend, you will want to test the following areas:  #### End-to-End (E2E) Tests - **Test Cases**: These verify entire application flows from user initiation to final result. This helps to ensure that the interaction between frontend and backend components works correctly. - **Test Tools**: You can use tools like Selenium, Katalon Studio, Postman, etc., which can simulate the interaction between your frontend UI and your backend REST APIs.    #### Unit Tests - **Unit Tests**: Covering individual methods of backend services. They are used to verify that each function in your backend code does its job without bugs. - **Test Frameworks**: You might use frameworks like Jest, JUnit, or even the built-in Node.js `mocha` and `chai` along with `supertest` for Node.js backend tests.  #### Integration Tests - **Test Cases**: Tests that check whether different backend services interact as expected. - **Testing Tools**: Tools like JMeter or Postman for HTTP requests and responses, as well as specialized integration testing frameworks like JUnit, which has support for database connections through Spring’s Junit configuration or similar frameworks.  ### 2. Frontend Testing For the frontend, you need to handle different scenarios as well:  #### E2E (End-to-End) Tests - **Browser Automation Tools**: These include Puppeteer, Cypress, Playwright. - **Test Scripts**: Write scripts to emulate user actions (like clicking buttons, typing in forms) and validate the results to match expected output. - **Stress Testing**: Use tools to simulate load and performance testing.  #### Unit Tests - **Jest**: A popular choice for unit testing frontend JavaScript, Vue, and Angular applications. It integrates well with other frameworks like React. - **Code Splitting**: Use Babel, Webpack, or other tools to optimize your test setup and make your application smaller and faster.  #### Mocking - **Mocking Libraries**: Tools like Axios or sinon are very useful for mocking backend API calls.    ### 3. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Use tools to integrate testing and deployment:  - **Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, Travis CI, GitLab CI** - Implement pipelines with build, tests, and deployment stages to automate testing and ensure that your application is tested before it is deployed.  ### Best Practices  1. **Use Version Control Systems**: Use Git with branch-based workflow for testing different versions of your code.  2. **Automated Reports**: Ensure that test reports generate a summary of test passes, failures, errors, and other metrics for easier tracking and analysis.  3. **Linter Tools**: Integrate linters (like ESLint, JSHint, Prettier) to maintain coding standards across your codebase.  4. **Database Validation**: Write SQL tests for your database operations (using frameworks like Mongoose, Sequelize).  5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation up to date and make sure developers know how to run the tests.  Remember that effective testing requires a combination of the above practices, and depending on the complexity and size of your application, you may need to further customize tests and configurations. For more detailed instructions and examples, you can refer to the respective frameworks' official documentation.\",\n",
    "\"The \\\"procfile not found\\\" error typically indicates that your application is configured to run using the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or [Supervisor](https://supervisor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) management system, but it cannot locate the `procfile`. Since you mentioned that you are creating a Python service, the error suggests there might be something wrong with the configuration related to Docker or Supervisor.  Here’s how you can troubleshoot this issue:  ### Steps to Resolve “Procfile Not Found” Error for Your Python Service:  1. **Check your Configuration:**    - Ensure that you have a `Procfile` in the root directory of your project. The `Procfile` should list your container’s command line arguments (e.g., `web: gunicorn your_project.wsgi --timeout 50` for a WSGI application).        ```bash    web: gunicorn your_project.wsgi --timeout 50    ```  2. **Validate Procfile Syntax:**    - Make sure the `Procfile` follows the correct syntax. It should use one word per line with spaces between words.  3. **Verify Deployment Context:**    - If you are using Docker Compose, ensure that `docker-compose.yml` contains the appropriate configuration to start your application (usually under the `services` section). This YAML file should reference your Python app in the way required by Docker Compose.  4. **Check the Deployment Tool Used:**    - Review how your deployment tool (if applicable) handles the configuration of your app. If you are deploying with Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, etc., double-check if these tools expect a `Procfile`.  5. **Use Supervisord Configuration:**    - For supervisord, make sure you have a `supervisord.conf` configuration file with your Python service specified in its `cmd` directive:     ```ini    [program:your_project]    command=/path/to/your_project/wrapper    stdout_logfile = /dev/null    stderr_logfile = /dev/null    numprocs=1    ```     And make sure to create the appropriate `wrapper` script:     ```sh    #!/bin/sh    /path/to/python your_project/app.py    ```  6. **Test Your Application Locally:**    - Ensure that running `gunicorn` (or similar process manager) works locally before attempting to deploy. Use commands like `docker-compose up -d` (for Docker) or `supervisord` command in `supervisord.conf` to bring up your service locally.  ### Additional Tips:  - **Log Analysis:** Always check the logs for any error messages or warnings that can provide more context on why the `Procfile` could not be found.   - **Refer to Documentation:** If none of the above steps work, review the relevant documentation or examples provided by the orchestrator or management system you are using.  If after going through these steps the problem persists, consider reaching out to the community or forums related to your deployment environment.\",\n",
    "\"To resolve the \\\"not found\\\" error for the `.choreo/endpoints.yaml` file in the Choreo platform, follow these steps:  1. **Check Configuration File Path**:    - Ensure that the configuration file `endpoints.yaml` exists in the correct directory structure. The file should be located in the appropriate service or application folder. For instance, if it's for a service named `myService`, it should be under `/src/main/services/myService`.  2. **Correct Directory Structure**:    - Make sure the directory path to your `endpoints.yaml` file is set correctly in the `src/main/config` directory. If your project has multiple layers, make sure the path reflects the layer structure, e.g., `/src/main/config/myService/endpoints.yaml`.  3. **Verify YAML Syntax**:    - Open the `endpoints.yaml` file and make sure the syntax is correct according to the Choreo specifications. Check if all required fields and structures are defined properly. This includes, but isn’t limited to, service name, API definitions, endpoint configurations, and more.  4. **Check Workspace Initialization**:    - Sometimes the workspace might not have been initialized or configured correctly. Start by cleaning the workspace (`mvn clean install`) to ensure no leftovers from previous executions affect the current configuration.     5. **Review Project Properties**:    - Make sure there are no typos in the properties files used by the Maven projects. These properties could be referencing the location of `endpoints.yaml`.  6. **Run Choreo Setup Commands**:    - If necessary, rerun the setup commands or scripts that configure the environment for running your application. Ensure the commands are correctly executed from the root of your workspace.  7. **Seek Further Documentation or Support**:    - If after checking all the above, the issue persists, refer to the official Choreo documentation or seek support from the community or support channels provided by the development team.  8. **Consult Code Samples and Examples**:    - Check Choreo code samples and examples to see if there are any examples available that could match the structure of your `endpoints.yaml` configuration.  By ensuring the file is present in the right directory, following a correct directory structure, and reviewing the configuration carefully, you can usually resolve this issue.\",\n",
    "\"To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, you typically do this through your service configuration, especially when setting up Kubernetes services or integrating services with Docker containers. Below is a guide on how to set it up in the context of Docker containers, which is common practice:  1. **Service Configuration:**    If you’re deploying a service as a standalone process using Docker, ensure the readiness probe is included in the container’s start-up process. The command line to run your Docker image can include a `--readiness-probe` flag.     - For Docker Compose, add it like so:    ```yaml    services:      service_name:        # ...other properties...        command: \\\"--readiness-probe /path/to/command\\\"    ```     - In a Docker container, specify the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` to handle the probe:    ```sh    CMD [\\\"/path/to/probe/script.sh\\\", \\\"/path/to/match/check\\\"]    ```    Make sure your script is capable of executing the required checks (e.g., checking the health status or running a command to verify the service is ready).  2. **Command Handling:**    Your Docker entrypoint script or command should periodically check the readiness state and exit based on the status:    - Use `CMD [\\\"check-service\\\", \\\"http://localhost:8080/status\\\"]`.    - Alternatively, use `/bin/sh -c` with a shell script for more complex logic.     3. **Probe Configuration Script:**    Write a script that can handle your specific health checks:    ```sh    # Check_script.sh    set -e     if $(curl --fail --head http://localhost:8080/service-status | grep -q 'HTTP/1.1 200 OK')    then      echo 'service_is_ready'      exit 0    else      echo 'service_not_ready'      exit 1    fi    ```  4. **Deployment in Choreo:**    Once deployed, make sure your application exposes the necessary endpoints and statuses that the probe script will check. This could be HTTP status codes, internal state, etc.  5. **Observation:**    You need to observe the result from your readiness probe. Depending on your environment and service setup, you may also monitor readiness probes externally using tools like Prometheus or Grafana.  Remember to adjust the URLs, port numbers, and commands according to your application's specific requirements. If you have any doubts about integrating these into your current workflow or need help with troubleshooting, refer back to the Choreo or Kubernetes documentation for more detailed guidance.\",\n",

    "\"To implement rate limiting on your APIs in Choreo, follow these steps:  ### Step 1: Create an API Blueprint Ensure you have defined your API in Choreo using its API blueprint format. You can find detailed guidelines on how to create API blueprints [here](https://docs.choreo.io/user-guide.html#creating-api-blueprint).  ### Step 2: Enable Rate Limiting in Your API Blueprint 1. In your API blueprint, add the `RateLimiting` feature. For example:    ```yaml    name: my-api    ...    endpoints:      /my-endpoint:        get:          requestMapping:            parameters:              - in: header                name: X-API-Key                description: Unique Key for accessing the endpoint                style: formurlencoded              - in: header                name: X-Rate-Limit-Header                required: false                type: string            responses:              200:                application/json: \\{\\}            operationId: get-my-endpoint          ...          securityDefinitions:            ApiKeySecurity:              type: api_key              in: header              x-choreo-name: X-API-Key              description: Unique Key for accessing the endpoint            RateLimiting:              type: x-rate-limit              in: header              x-choreo-name: X-Rate-Limit-Header              required: false              x-default-max-age: 86400  # Maximum age of the request in seconds (one day)              x-default-max-requests: 500  # Maximum number of requests allowed per client              x-default-burst: 1000  # Maxiumum number of simultaneous requests    ```  ### Step 3: Apply Rate Limiting Configuration Set up the rate limit settings according to your needs. The above example defines: - **Maximum Age:** 86400 seconds (One day) - **Maximum Requests:** 500 per client - **Burst:** 1000 maximum simultaneous requests  ### Step 4: Deploy Your API Blueprint After configuring the rate limit settings, deploy your updated API blueprint.  ### Step 5: Monitor and Optimize Use Choreo’s monitoring tools to check how your API performs under various load conditions. You can also make adjustments as needed, such as increasing the `x-default-max-requests` value for lower traffic situations or reducing the maximum number of requests when experiencing high volume.

    "\"Trivy is a tool designed for scanning for vulnerabilities in container images and local Docker images, and it reports issues that may prevent your code from running correctly. The error messages from Trivy typically indicate a specific issue, which might be due to missing dependencies or incorrect configurations. Here’s how you can resolve common Trivy errors:  1. **Missing Dependencies**: These often appear when a package or library is required but is missing from your image. Ensure that all required packages listed in your `Dockerfile` are included, and consider installing them with `RUN apt-get install <package>` for Ubuntu-like systems or `RUN yum install -y <package>` for RHEL/CentOS-based systems.     Example:    ```dockerfile    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget && rm -v /var/lib/apt/lists/*    # Or    RUN yum install -y wget    ```  2. **Incorrect Configuration Files**: If Trivy identifies issues with configuration files (like `/etc/someconfig.conf`), ensure these files are present and correctly set up. For example, you might need to add the missing section or set correct options.  3. **Package Not Available Over APT/MANAGE_REPOS=true**: If your repository setup doesn't include some necessary packages, you can manually add repositories or use tools like `apt-get install -t <arch>` to access older versions.     Example for adding a custom repository:    ```dockerfile    RUN curl https://example.com/repository | apt-get install -y dpkg    ```  4. **Security Updates or Dependency Incompatibility**: Ensure you are using the right versions of your dependencies and that the updates provided by your system's repositories match the ones in your image. Use `apt-get upgrade` or manage your packages directly with `pip`, `npm`, etc., as appropriate.  5. **Permissions Issues**: Ensure that any configuration or data files require the correct ownership or permissions. You can adjust these with commands like:    ```dockerfile    RUN chown -R someuser:somedir /somepath    ```  6. **Network Errors**: Ensure you have a network connection if you're fetching remote dependencies or data. Disable caching if necessary or add `-n` option when executing commands:    ```dockerfile    RUN apt-get install -n wget    ```  7. **Check Trivy Output**: Always review the complete output generated by Trivy, focusing on error lines and their context in the log. This helps pinpoint exactly what dependency or file might be missing.  Referencing the [Charm Documentation](https://charms.com/docs/stable/security/using/) might also be beneficial, depending on the version of Charm and its specific integrations. Always ensure you are checking the latest release notes or support pages for additional guidelines. If stuck, contacting the Charm community forums or Support channels is recommended.

    "\"Adding a configuration file to a React web application typically involves setting up your application's settings, environment variables, and secrets. This helps in maintaining your project's parameters without directly hardcoding them into your codebase. Here’s a step-by-step guide:  ### Step 1: Define Your Configuration Variables Create or define the necessary configurations in environment variables or a `config.json` or `config.js` file (if it's JavaScript-based).  ### Step 2: Use .env File for Local Development If this is a local development project, you can use the `.env` file. It is useful for storing environment-specific variables such as database connection URLs, API keys, etc.  #### Example `.env` File: ``` PORT=3000 DB_HOST=localhost DB_USER=root DB_PASSWORD=rootpassword JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey ```  To set environment variables from your `.env` file, you can use tools like `dotenv`. Make sure you install it via npm before initializing your project:  ```bash npm install dotenv ```  In your root directory (`package.json`), configure a script:  ```json \\\"scripts\\\": {     \\\"start\\\": \\\"node server.js\\\",     \\\"dev\\\": \\\"node -r dotenv/config server.js\\\" }, ```  And create or modify your entry point, `server.js` (for Express): ```javascript require('dotenv').config(); // Load env vars const { PORT } = require('./config'); const app = express(); app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`App running on PORT ${PORT}`)); ```  ### Step 3: Use `.env.local` for Different Environments If you have environment-specific configurations, you can add an extra `.env.local` file. The `.local` file overrides default values defined in `.env`.  ### Step 4: Use Configuration Management Libraries For larger projects, consider using dedicated configuration libraries or modules. For example, using `config`:  #### Example Configuration File (`config/index.js`): ```javascript module.exports = {     PORT: process.env.PORT || 3000,     DB_CONNECTION: {         HOST: process.env.DB_HOST || 'localhost',         USER: process.env.DB_USER || 'root',         PASSWORD: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || 'rootpassword',     },     JWT_SECRET: process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'mysecretkey' }; ```  ### Step 5: Access Configurations Throughout Your Application Now you can easily access these configurations anywhere in your project using `config`.  ### Example Accessing Configuration in Component (`src/components/App.js`):  ```javascript import { config } from './config';  function App() {     const dbConfig = config.db_connection;     return <div>Config: {JSON.stringify(dbConfig)}</div>; }  export default App; ```  This approach keeps your configuration out of your project files and ensures that any changes made in one part of your application reflect the right settings for all instances.  For more detailed instructions, including how to initialize a project if you're new to React, check out the official React documentation on [creating a new React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-react-app.html). Additionally, the official [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_environment) provides insight into managing environment variables in Node.js applications.\",\n",
    "\"Securing your web app involves several important steps to protect your application and its data.

    "\"To control traffic to your API within Choreo, you have a few options depending on your needs, such as managing the rate limit of your API calls and handling the volume of incoming requests efficiently. Here are some steps to manage traffic:  ### 1. Configure Rate Limiting Choreo provides mechanisms for limiting how often certain types of messages (or events, like webhook requests) can be sent or processed.  #### Steps for Setting Up Rate Limiting:  - **Go to the Choreo Console**: Log into the Choreo Console and go to the \\\"Monitor\\\" section, or head straight to the \\\"Services & Integrations\\\" page if it's already there.    - **Configure Rate Limiting Policy**:   - If you’re using the Choreo Management API, navigate to `RateLimit` settings under your service. Here, you can create and configure a rate limiting policy. This allows you to specify limits for the number of messages that can be sent per time interval (for instance, per hour).  - **Save Changes**: Once you’ve configured your rate limiting policy, make sure to save your settings.  ### 2. Handling Large Amounts of Incoming Requests If you anticipate a large influx of requests that might overload your service, consider setting up additional controls like back-end throttling.  #### Steps for Back-End Throttling: - **Set Up Middleware in Your Backend**:   - Use a backend library (like Node.js, Python, etc.) to set up middleware or filters that automatically manage incoming requests according to the defined policies. This is a more advanced topic and depends on your application framework.  For example, in Node.js, you could set up request quotas or implement rate-limit middleware.  ### 3. Implementing Webhooks Rate Limits Webhooks in Choreo allow you to handle external consumer requests, which can sometimes pose scalability challenges.  #### Example for Using Rate Limiting for Webhooks: - **Rate Limiting Middleware**: Use a middleware that implements rate limiting logic for each webhook subscription, so you can control how frequently a consumer can call your webhook endpoint.  Here’s a simplified example of how to achieve this using Express in Node.js: ```javascript const express = require('express'); const { createThrottleMiddleware } = require('express-throttle');  const app = express(); const rateLimitOptions = {     throttleLimit: 500000, // 500 requests per second (per client)     maxRequestsPerSecond: 50, };  // Define the throttling middleware for your API app.use(createThrottleMiddleware(rateLimitOptions, '/yourapiendpoint'));  app.post('/yourapiendpoint', async (req, res) => {     console.log(req.throttleInfo.rate); // Logs the rate information if exceeded     res.json({ message: 'Webhook received successfully' }); });  app.listen(3000, () => {     console.log('Server running on port 3000'); }); ```  - **Install Required Libraries**:   ```shell   npm install express-throttle   ```  This guide should help you get started with configuring traffic control for your API in Choreo. For a more detailed implementation and specific to Choreo’s setup, consider referring to the [Choreo Management API Documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AMR630/Managing+API+Traffic).

    "\"Securing secret keys such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or other sensitive information is crucial for maintaining the security of your applications. Here’s how you can securely manage these secrets for a React web application:  ### 1. Environment Variables The most common and secure way to manage secrets is through environment variables. This method allows you to separate sensitive information from your codebase.  #### Step-by-Step Guide Using `dotenv` Library 1. **Install dotenv:**    First, install the dotenv package if it’s not already included in your project.    ```bash    npm install dotenv    ``` 2. **Configure Environment Variables:**    Create or add the necessary `.env` file in the root directory of your project with your secret configurations, e.g.,     ```env    SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey    PORT=3000    ``` 3. **Load Environment Variables:**    Modify your main entry point (e.g., `index.js`, `app.js`) to load environment variables from the `.env` file.    ```js    require('dotenv').config();     const SECRET_KEY = process.env.SECRET_KEY;    const PORT = process.env.PORT;     // Use your environment variable inside the app logic    const app = express();    ```  ### 2. Secrets Manager Alternatively, you can use a secrets manager tool like AWS Secrets Manager or Vault for managing your secret keys.  #### Using AWS Secrets Manager Example (CLI) 1. **Register and Setup:**    - Enable the AWS SDK and setup a configuration file for CLI to authenticate. 2. **Deploy Secret Key:**    Deploy the secret key to the secret manager. 3. **Retrieve Secret:**    Access the secret key in your application using the secret manager tool.  ### 3. Service Discovery and Authentication (JWTs etc.) If your application involves authentication, you could use JWTs to handle authentication rather than relying on static secrets. JWTs include claims that allow client-side access controls.  #### Example (Node.js and Passport): 1. **Install required packages:**    ```bash    npm install passport passport-http-jwt    ```  2. **Set Up Configuration in Your Server Code:**    ```js    const JwtStrategy = require('passport-http-jwt').Strategy;    const ExtractJwt = require('passport-http-jwt').ExtractJwt;     const options = {        secretOrKey: process.env.JWT_SECRET,        algorithms: ['HS256'],    };     passport.use(new JwtStrategy(options, async function (jwtSecret, jwtData, done) {        if (jwtData) {            return done(null, jwtData);        } else {            return done(null, false);        }    }));     app.use(passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false }), function(req, res, next) {        // Authorized routes here        next();    });    ```  ### Recommendations - Always avoid hardcoding secrets directly into your application code. - Consider encrypting secrets before storing them and decrypt them at runtime for better security practices. - Use HTTPS and regularly update and audit your security settings.  ### Documentation Links - [Choreo API Management](https://docs.choreo.io/) - For any Choreo related secrets management within the platform. - [npm Package Installation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) - General guidance on how to install dependencies, including `dotenv`. - [AWS Secrets Manager Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/welcome.html) - Official documentation for using AWS Secrets Manager.

    "\"To restrict your API such that only administrators can see it in Choreo, you can follow these steps:  1. **Create an Administrator User Role**:    - Log into your Choreo account.    - Navigate to the \\\"Admin\\\" section under the settings or dashboard.  2. **Define Permissions for Admin Users**:    - Within the settings section, go to the \\\"Roles and Permissions\\\" area to configure the admin user roles.    - Assign specific permissions that will be associated with being an admin. For API access, you might assign the highest level of permission which includes managing and accessing APIs.  3. **Restrict API Visibility to Admin Users**:    - Go to the \\\"API Management\\\" section where you can manage and list all APIs.    - In the settings for each API, find the option that allows you to specify which user groups can view the API.    - By default, new users won't have direct access to all APIs. Use the user group settings to ensure that only users with admin roles (and thus, those who are marked as administrators) are able to see your protected API.  4. **Update User Groups**:    - Ensure that the user groups have the admin role. This is usually done in the \\\"User Roles\\\" section.    - When you update user roles to mark users as administrators, this also configures the visibility settings.  5. **Verify Access Control**:    - After making the changes, log out and back in, or refresh your current session. Only authenticated admin users will have access to see and interact with the restricted APIs.  Here's some more detail on the steps above, with links to specific areas in the Choreo UI:  - For creating a role:    - Click on the “Roles & Permissions” section and click on the “Edit Roles & Permissions” button, then define and save roles.  - For assigning the role to users:   - Navigate to the User Management page, edit the user's role, and select the appropriate administrator role from the dropdown.  If you need more detailed steps on navigating to specific sections, you can refer to the [official Choreo documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CHOREO), where you can find step-by-step guides for different parts of the Choreo system.\",\n",
    "\"To start using the Choreo Command Line Interface (CLI) on your computer, follow these steps:  1. **Install Java**:    - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher installed on your system. The CLI requires Java for its execution.    - To check your Java version:      ```bash      java -version      ```    - If necessary, install JDK 8 or later from the Oracle website or open source alternatives like OpenJDK.  2. **Add Choreo to PATH**:    - After installing JDK, download the Choreo CLI distribution file (`.tar.gz`) from the official Choreo website or the WSO2 Maven repository if you have the Maven environment set up.    - Unzip the downloaded `.tar.gz` file and navigate to the Choreo CLI directory in your terminal.    - To add the Choreo CLI directory to your system's PATH variable, follow these steps for your respective operating systems:       - For **Windows**:        - Locate the path of the choreo directory. Typically, it’s located inside `choreo-x.y.z-win64` (where `x.y.z` is your version number).        - Add the following line to your Windows Environment Variable:          ```cmd          set PATH=%PATH%;%choreo_home%\\\\bin          ```        - Replace `%\\choreo_home%` with the actual directory location. Open the `Environment Variables` in System Properties and modify the PATH accordingly.       - For **macOS/Linux**:        - First, open Terminal.        - Create a symbolic link or manually copy the Choreo CLI scripts into your local shell startup file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) depending on your shell type:          ```bash          ln -s /path/to/choreo/home/bin choreo          ```          - Where `/path/to/choreo/home` is the root path where you extracted the Choreo distribution.          - Alternatively, you can manually add a new command by appending the Choreo CLI binary (`./bin/choreo`) to your local shell startup file:            ```bash            echo \\\"export PATH=\\\"$PATH:$HOME/Path_To_your_choreo/home/bin\\\";\\\" >> ~/.zshrc            ```       - After making changes to the PATH:        ```bash        source ~/.zshrc  # For Zsh        source ~/.bashrc # For Bash        ```  3. **Check if the CLI is correctly installed**:    - Navigate back to a shell terminal window where PATH was added.    - Type `choreo` and press Enter to verify if the CLI is working correctly.    - Expected Output:      ```      Usage:      choreo [command] [command options]      For detailed usage information on a command use:      choreo [command] --help      Examples:      choreo api create      choreo app create      choreo login      ...      ```  By successfully completing these steps, you should now be able to run Choreo CLI commands in your system.\",\n",
    "\"To configure your applications in Choreo to scale automatically, you typically leverage automatic scaling services which are often enabled through cloud platforms or auto-scaling policies configured within your Choreo setup. However, in Choreo, this usually involves defining scaling policies for your microservices and integrating them with a cloud provider's auto-scaling service (like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google Cloud Run, etc.) which can then trigger auto-scaling actions based on predefined conditions like CPU usage, memory consumption, etc.  Here’s a general guideline on how you might set up scaling within Choreo:  1. **Microservice Configuration**:    - Define your microservices in Choreo with proper configurations including the environment-specific settings (local testing, development, staging, production) that can vary in terms of memory size, CPU requirements, etc.     2. **Scaling Policies**:    - Define scaling policies within Choreo that trigger when certain conditions are met (e.g., CPU utilization above a certain level). This helps in dynamically allocating resources based on actual resource usage.  3. **Integration with Auto-Scaling Service**:    - Configure Choreo to be integrated with an auto-scaling service of your choice. For example, if using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Choreo can use metrics from AWS and autoscale the deployment based on those metrics.  4. **Cloud Provider Management Console**:    - Manage these settings through your cloud provider’s management console, following best practices for configuring autoscaling rules, thresholds, and cooldown periods to avoid rapid scaling that could overwhelm resources.  5. **Choreo Integration Settings**:    - In Choreo, navigate to the \\\"Settings\\\" or \\\"Integrations\\\" section, depending on the version of Choreo, and find settings related to scaling configurations. These may include selecting which metrics to monitor and what action to take (increase or decrease the number of instances).  6. **Testing and Monitoring**:    - Before deploying a microservice that will handle scaled-up traffic, perform extensive testing in your dev or test environment to ensure everything works as expected during automatic scaling scenarios.  For more detailed steps, you might refer to the Choreo user manual or the specific auto-scaling services documentation provided by your cloud provider.\",\n",
    "\"If your service is experiencing overload with too many requests, here are some steps you can take to address the issue:  1. **Load Balancing**:    - Distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of your service to spread the load. This can be achieved by configuring load balancers. Refer to [Choreo's documentation on Load Balancers](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CL/Predetermined+Load+Balancer).  2. **Caching Mechanisms**:    - Implement caching strategies to store results of expensive operations, thereby reducing the number of requests that reach the backend service. You can use a distributed cache solution or a dedicated caching service. Consult the [Choreo Caching](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CHOREO910/Caching) guide for more details.  3. **Throttling**:    - Set up rate limiting and throttling policies to manage the request volume. You can configure these settings in Choreo through its policy editor. Look at [Throttling](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AMR14/Throttle+a+Service#Throttleaservice-PolicyManagement).  4. **Service Health Checks and Failover**:    - Ensure that your service is designed to handle failures and perform failover to other instances automatically. Choreo supports automatic scaling which can also mitigate load spikes. Review the [Choreo Service Failover](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CL/Service+Failover) documentation.  5. **Optimize Performance and Response Times**:    - Review performance bottlenecks and optimize your service code and API design. Use Choreo’s tools to monitor your service’s performance and make necessary adjustments.  6. **Queue Management**:    - If applicable, set up message queues between your consumer applications and your service to decouple them. This can provide a queue for handling high request loads and managing concurrency. The documentation on [Queues](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EIaddon-GettingstartedwithMessages) might be useful.  7. **Implement Retry and Error Handling**:    - Ensure that your application can retry failed requests and manage error messages appropriately. This helps in gracefully handling temporary failures. Refer to [Retry and Fault Tolerance](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EIDG/Retry-and-Fault-Tolerance) for detailed instructions.  By following these steps, you can effectively manage and distribute the load on your Choreo service.

         "How can I add environment variables to python webapp?",
         "To add environment variables to a Python web application in the context of Choreo (an iPaaS tool), you would typically configure environment variables at the deployment stage rather than within the Python code itself. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:  1. **Define Environment Variables in Choreo:**    - Log in to your Choreo account.    - Navigate to the workspace where you have deployed or plan to deploy your Python web application.    - Use the `Variables` section of Choreo to define the environment variables required by your application.  2. **Use the Variables in Your Python Code:**    - In your Python web application, you can access these environment variables using common Python methods.   Here is an example of how to do this:  ### Step 1: Define Environment Variables in Choreo  1. Go to the `Variables` tab under the `Design` or `Deploy` section of your Python web app in Choreo. 2. Add the required environment variables. For example:    ```plaintext    - Variable Name: DATABASE_URI    - Variable Value: postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname    ```    Repeat this step for each environment variable needed by your application.  ### Step 2: Access Environment Variables in Python  Once the variables are defined in Choreo, you can access them in your Python code as follows:  ```python from dotenv import load_dotenv import os  # Load environment variables from Choreo into .env file load_dotenv()  DATABASE_URI = os.getenv('DATABASE_URI') SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY') ```  Alternatively, if you prefer not to use a `.env` file, you can directly access the variables using the following approach:  ```python import os  DATABASE_URI = os.getenv('DATABASE_URI', 'default_value') SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'default_secret_key') ```  ### Step 3: Ensure Variables are Available at Runtime  - Make sure the environment variables are available when the application starts. This is usually managed by Choreo's deployment mechanism.  By following these steps, you ensure that your Python web application has access to the necessary environment variables, which can be easily managed and updated through Choreoâ€™s configuration interface.",
         "To set up environment variables in **Choreo**, follow these steps:\n\n**Steps to Apply Environment Variables**\n\n1. **Navigate to Your Component in Choreo Console**:\n - Go to the **Component Listing** pane and click on the component you want to configure.\n\n2.

         "How to connect the React frontend to the backend?",
         "Connecting a React frontend to a backend can be done through various methods, including HTTP requests. Choreo provides a robust environment to manage APIs, which can be used as the backend endpoint from your React application. Below are the steps to set up a connection:  ### Step 1: Expose Your Backend Service as an API in Choreo  1. **Log into Choreo:**    - Go to [Choreo](https://choreo.wso2.com/) and log in to your account.  2. **Create an API:**    - Navigate to the â€œAPIsâ€ section and create a new API or select an existing one that will serve as the backend.    - If you have an existing backend, you might need to expose it as an API via a Gateway like WSO2 API Manager or configure it directly in Choreo if supported.  3. **Define API Details:**    - Set the `Provider` and `Consumer`.    - Define the `Resource Paths` and `HTTP Methods` for your API.    - Set up `Authentication`, `Rate Limiting`, and any other necessary settings.  4. **Publish the API:**    - Once everything is set, publish the API to make it available.  ### Step 2: Configure Axios in Your React Application  Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests in JavaScript applications.  1. **Install Axios:**    ```sh    npm install axios    ```  2. **Import Axios in Your React Component:**     ```javascript    import axios from 'axios';     function fetchData() {      axios.get('YOUR_API_URL_HERE')        .then(response => {          console.log('Data:', response.data);        })        .catch(error => {          console.error('Error:', error);        });    }     // Example usage:    fetchData();    ```  3. **Replace `YOUR_API_URL_HERE` with the URL of the API endpoint in Choreo.**  4. **Set Up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**    - If you are facing CORS issues, you may need to configure CORS in your Choreo API or use proxy settings in your React application.  5. **Authentication (Optional):**    - If your API requires authentication, you can pass the token in the headers of the request.    ```javascript    axios.get('YOUR_API_URL_HERE', {      headers: {        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'      }    })    ```  6. **Example of Making a POST Request with Headers:**     ```javascript    async function postData(data) {      const config = {        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }      };       const response = await axios.post('YOUR_API_URL_HERE', data, config);      return response.data;    }    ```  ### Step 3: Test Your Connection  1. **Run Your React Application:**    ```sh    npm start    ```  2. **Invoke Your Backend API:**    - Use the console or an HTTP client like Postman to test the API endpoint.  3. **Check Logs and Console Output:**    - Check the console output for any errors or success messages.  By following these steps, you should be able to successfully connect your React frontend to a backend service configured in Choreo. For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [official Choreo documentation](https://apim.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/user-guide/connecting-apis/) and the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html) on making HTTP requests.",

         "How can I implement testing for a full-stack application including automated testing for both frontend and backend components?",
         "Choreo itself is primarily designed for API connectivity and does not include built-in testing tools for front-end or back-end development. However, you can use Choreo for managing and testing your APIs as part of a larger testing strategy that might involve tools like Postman, Cypress, Selenium for frontend testing, and unit test frameworks for backend tests.  Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to integrating testing into your full-stack application:  ### Step 1: Define Your Testing Strategy - **Identify APIs**: List out all your backend and frontend APIs. - **Determine Testing Scope**: Decide what needs to be tested, e.g., functionality, performance, security.  ### Step 2: Set Up Integration Tests Using Choreo Choreo can be used for API gateway purposes, which can indirectly contribute to your testing strategy.  - **Create a Mock Service in Choreo**: Use Choreoâ€™s mock service feature to simulate backend endpoints. This is useful for testing your frontend components in isolation. - **API Testing via Choreo**: Use Choreo as an API testing tool by creating test scenarios in the Choreo console or via API operations.  #### Instructions: 1. Navigate to your Choreo account and go to Services. 2. Click on `+New` to create a new mock service. 3. Configure your service details and set up endpoints as necessary. 4. Create test cases by using the Choreo API testing feature to call these endpoints. 5. Save your tests.  ### Step 3: Automate API Tests Using CI/CD Use your CI/CD pipeline to run automated tests on your backend APIs.  #### Example using GitHub Actions (CI/CD Platform): ```yaml name: Test Backend APIs  on:    push:     branches: [ main ]   pull_request:     branches: [ main ]  jobs:   test-backend-apis:     runs-on: ubuntu-latest     steps:       - uses: actions/checkout@v2       - name: Set up Node.js         uses: actions/setup-node@v2         with:           node-version: '14'       - name: Install dependencies         run: npm install       - name: Run unit tests         run: npm test -- backend/api-test.js ```  ### Step 4: Implement Frontend Testing For frontend testing, you would typically use JavaScript-based frameworks like Cypress or Selenium.  #### Example using Cypress (frontend testing tool): ```javascript // cypress/integration/login.spec.js describe('Login Form', () => {   it('should log in successfully with valid credentials', () => {     cy.visit('/')     cy.get('#email').type('test@example.com')     cy.get('#password').type('password123')     cy.get('.login-button').click()     cy.url().should('eq', 'http://localhost:3000/dashboard')   }) }) ```  ### Step 5: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Ensure that both your backend and frontend are integrated in your CI/CD pipeline, allowing tests to be run automatically on every commit or merge request.  ### Additional Tips: - **Environment Management**: Use Choreo to manage different environments like dev, staging, and prod to ensure consistent behavior across different stages. - **Observability**: Use Choreo to monitor API performance and usage, which can help identify issues during testing and real-world usage.  By integrating these tools and practices, you can effectively test and validate your full-stack application, leveraging Choreo for API testing while combining it with frontend testing tools like Cypress or Selenium.",

Here's how you can resolve this issue:  1. **Ensure Procfile Exists**:    - Verify that you have created a `Procfile` in the root directory of your project. The `Procfile` should contain one line with the format: `web: python your_script.py`.    - Example `Procfile` content:      ```      web: python myapp.py      ```  2. **Check Directory Structure**:    - Ensure the `Procfile` is placed in the root of your project directory, where it will be picked up during deployment.    - Verify that there are no typos in the filename or the path specified in the `Procfile`.  3. **Deploy Configuration**:    - In Choreo, go to the Integration tab where you configure and manage your integrations.    - Make sure the `Procfile` is being referenced correctly in the deployment settings for your Python service.    - Double-check the build and deployment settings to ensure they match the requirements for running a Python application (e.g., Python version).  4. **Build and Deployment Steps**:    - Ensure that the correct build steps are configured to handle Python dependencies if needed. This might include installing a `requirements.txt` file.    - Confirm that the deployment command or process in the Choreo UI reflects the intended behavior (e.g., running the specified script).  5. **Logs and Monitoring**:    - Check the logs and monitoring dashboard provided by Choreo to see if there are any additional clues about why the procfile might be missing or not recognized.    - Look for messages related to file paths, permissions, or other environmental issues.  If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, you may need to consult the official Choreo documentation for detailed guidance on deploying Python services:  - [Choreo Deployment Documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/WAMUI/API+Management+Integrations+Guide)  Additionally, if you are using any specific Choreo features like CI/CD pipelines, make sure those are set up correctly to support your Python service deployments.",
         "The error you're encountering is because Choreo requires a `Procfile` in your Python project's root directory. A `Procfile` is a configuration file used to declare the commands that are run by your application's containers. \n\nFor a Python project, your `Procfile` might look something like this:\n```\nweb: <command to start your application>\n``` \nFor example, if you're using Flask, your `Procfile` should look like this:\n```\nweb: flask run --host=0.0.0.0\n```\n\nPlease ensure that you have a `Procfile` in your project root directory and that it contains the appropriate command to start your application.

         "I'm getting .choreo/endpoints.yaml not found error. How do I resolve this?",
         "The `.choreo/endpoints.yaml` file typically contains configuration settings for endpoints used in your integration flow. If you're encountering a `Not Found` error related to this file, here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:  1. **Verify Configuration Directory**:    - Ensure that the directory structure is correct. The `.choreo` folder should be located in the root of your project.    - Check if the `.choreo/endpoints.yaml` file exists in your project. If it's missing, you might need to create it.  2. **Create `.choreo/endpoints.yaml` File**:    - If the file does not exist, you can create it by running the following command:      ```sh      choreo init --type endpoints      ```    - Alternatively, you can manually create the file and add the necessary endpoint configurations. An example structure looks like:      ```yaml      endpoints:        - name: ExampleEndpoint          url: https://example.com/api          method: GET          headers:            Content-Type: application/json      ```  3. **Check Environment Variable**:    - Make sure that any environment variables required by the `.choreo/endpoints.yaml` are correctly set in your environment. You can use environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive information or values that might change across different environments (like staging and production).  4. **Re-run Integration**:    - After making changes to the configuration file or setting environment variables, re-run your integration to see if the issue is resolved.  5. **Check Logs**:    - Examine the logs for more detailed information about what might be causing the `Not Found` error. Logs can provide insights into whether the file path is being recognized correctly.  6. **Consult Documentation**:    - Refer to the [official Choreo documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CHE/Getting+Started+with+WSO2+Choreo) for additional guidance on using configuration files and troubleshooting common issues.

         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, you need to follow these steps:  1. **Open the Service Editor:**    - Navigate to the **Services** tab in Choreo.    - Locate the service you want to configure the readiness probe for.    - Click on the **Edit** icon next to the service.  2. **Access the Advanced Settings:**    - Scroll down to the **Advanced** section of the service editor.    - Ensure that the **Expose API** switch is toggled to **On**.  3. **Configure Readiness Probes:**    - Under the **Advanced** section, locate the **Readiness Probes** configuration area.    - Choreo supports configuring readiness probes through HTTP endpoints. To set up a readiness probe, you need to define the URL and any additional parameters like timeout, period, failure threshold, etc.  4. **Define the HTTP Endpoint:**    - Set the **Readiness URL** to point to the endpoint that returns a healthy response (e.g., `http://your-service:port/ready`).    - Set the **Path** if necessary (usually `/ready` for readiness checks).  5. **Set Interval and Timeout:**    - Set the **Interval** (e.g., `30s`) to specify how often the probe is executed.    - Set the **Timeout** (e.g., `10s`) to specify how long the probe will wait for a response before it fails.  6. **Set Retries and Success/Failure Thresholds:**    - Define the **Failure Threshold** (e.g., `3`) which specifies how many consecutive failures must occur before the container is marked as unhealthy.    - Optionally, set the **Success Threshold** (e.g., `1`) which specifies how many consecutive successes are required to mark the container as healthy after being un healthy.  7. **Save Your Changes:**    - Click on **Save** to apply your changes.  ### Example Configuration ```plaintext # Sample configuration Readiness URL: http://your-service:8080/ready Path: /ready Interval: 30s Timeout: 10s Failure Threshold: 3 Success Threshold: 1 ```  ### Troubleshooting - Ensure the endpoint is accessible from within the container and returns a successful HTTP response (`2xx` or `3xx` indicating redirection). - Check the network policies and security settings within Choreo to ensure that the endpoint can be reached. - Review any logs or monitoring data to ensure the probes are being executed correctly and interpret their results accurately.  For detailed instructions, refer to the official Choreo documentation:  - [Configure Health Checks](https://wso2.com/library/tutorials/2020/11/configuring-health-checks-for-apim-and-wso2-product-gateways-with-choreo)  This process should allow you to successfully configure and manage readiness probes in your Choreo services for better service reliability and uptime.",
         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to configure readiness probes.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

         "How can I add a config file to react web app?",
         "It seems like there might be some confusion regarding adding configuration files to a React web app. React itself is a frontend JavaScript library, and it does not directly manage backend integrations or configuration files. However, if your goal is to manage configurations in a way that works well with a backend (or services) integrated with your React application, you can use the following approaches:  ### 1. **Environment Variables** For managing configuration variables that can vary between environments (development, staging, production), you can use environment variables. This method allows you to store sensitive information such as API keys or database credentials without hardcoding them into your React code.  #### Steps to set up environment variables in a React app:  - **Create Environment Variables File:**   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your React project. For example:   ```   API_KEY=myapikey   DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017   ```  - **Access Environment Variables in Code:**   In your React components, you can access these variables using `process.env`:   ```jsx   import React from 'react';    function App() {     return (       <div>         <h1>Welcome to the App</h1>         <p>The API key is: {process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}</p>       </div>     );   }    export default App;   ```    Note: Ensure that `REACT_APP_` prefix is used before any variable name starting with uppercase letters in `.env` files.  ### 2. **External Configuration Files (Optional)** If you need more complex configuration settings (like JSON objects), you can create a JSON file and use it in your React app. However, this is not a recommended practice for sensitive data. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.  #### Steps to use a JSON configuration file:  - **Create Config File:**   ```json   // config.json   {     \"api\": {       \"url\": \"https://api.example.com\"     },     \"database\": {       \"url\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017\"     }   }   ```  - **Read the File in Your React App:**   ```javascript   import React from 'react';   import fs from 'fs';   import path from 'path';    const configPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'config.json');   let config;    try {     config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(configPath, 'utf8'));   } catch (error) {     console.error('Failed to load config:', error);   }    function App() {     return (       <div>         <h1>Welcome to the App</h1>         <p>The API URL is: {config.api.url}</p>       </div>     );   }    export default App;   ```  ### 3. **Integrating with Backend Services** If your React app needs to interact with backend services or integrations (which might be managed by Choreo), you would typically use APIs provided by those services.  - **Using APIs in React:**   ```jsx   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';    function App() {     const [data, setData] = useState(null);      useEffect(() => {       fetch('/api/data') // Assume '/api/data' is an endpoint provided by your backend service         .then(response => response.json())         .then(data => setData(data))         .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));     }, []);      return (       <div>         <h1>Welcome to the App</h1>         <p>Data fetched from backend: {data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</p>       </div>     );   }    export default App;   ```  This approach ensures that you can dynamically configure your application through external services integrated via Choreo or through environment variables, keeping your code clean and secure.  For more detailed information on managing configurations in React applications, you might want to refer to the official React documentation on [Working with Environment Variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-config/).",
         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it. You can create a config file mount via the Configurations pane on the Deploy page in the Choreo Console.",

         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component. Using this method you can secure your web application.",

         "How do I set up automatic scaling for my applications?",
         "Choreo itself does not directly support auto-scaling for applications as it is more focused on integration, API management, and automation. However, you can integrate Choreo with other cloud-native services or platforms that offer auto-scaling capabilities. Hereâ€™s a general approach on how you might achieve this:  1. **Identify the Auto-Scaling Solution**:    - Use cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, or Kubernetes for auto-scaling capabilities.    - Consider using managed services such as Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).  2. **Deploy Your Application Using Choreo**:    - Create an API Proxy in Choreo to expose your application or API.    - Set up external consumers to call this API Proxy, effectively routing traffic to your application.  3. **Connect Choreo to the Auto-Scaling Service**:    - **Monitoring**: Configure monitoring to track application metrics such as CPU usage, response time, and request volume.       - Use Prometheus for collecting monitoring data if it aligns with your environment.    - **Trigger Scaling Events**: Connect the monitoring data from Prometheus to an auto-scaling service.      - Use AWS CloudWatch for AWS environments.      - Use Azure Monitor for Azure environments.      - Use Stackdriver for GCP environments.  4. **Set Up Scaling Policies**:    - Define when and how many instances should be scaled up or down based on the monitoring data.    - Use the appropriate configuration for the chosen auto-scaling solution:      - **For AWS**:        - Refer to [AWS Auto Scaling documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-how-asg-scale.html).      - **For Kubernetes**:        - Configure horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA):           ```yaml          apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2          kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler          metadata:            name: example-app          spec:            scaleTargetRef:              apiVersion: apps/v1              kind: Deployment              name: example-app            minReplicas: 1            maxReplicas: 10            metrics:            - type: Resource              resource:                name: cpu                targetAverageUtilization: 80          ```  5. **Automate and Test**:    - Ensure that all integrations between Choreo, the auto-scaling service, and monitoring are correctly configured.    - Test the setup thoroughly to ensure that auto-scaling works as expected under different loads.  6. **Monitor and Optimize**:    - Continuously monitor the performance of your application and adjust the scaling policies as needed.    - Refine the thresholds for triggering auto-scaling events to achieve optimal resource utilization and cost efficiency.  By following these steps, you can leverage Choreo for integrating your applications while utilizing external auto-scaling services provided by cloud providers or managed Kubernetes services.   For detailed guides on specific tools and services, refer to their official documentation linked in this answer.",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "My build fails during trivy scan",
         "It sounds like you're encountering issues with the Trivy scan failing during your build process. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot this issue:  1. **Check Trivy Configuration**:    - Ensure that your `trivy` configuration file (usually `trivy.conf`) is correctly set up. This includes specifying the paths to scan, image layers to skip, etc.    ```yaml    paths:      - /path/to/image  # Specify the path to your Docker image(s)    exclude-paths:      - \"/path/to/excluded/image\"  # Exclude any specific image layers if needed    ```  2. **Verify Permissions**:    - Ensure that the user running the build has the necessary permissions to execute Trivy scans and access the required files or directories.  3. **Review Docker Image Layers**:    - Sometimes specific layers in your Docker image may contain sensitive information or paths that cause failures. Review these layers and ensure they do not contain inappropriate content.    - You can also exclude specific paths from the scan if certain layers are causing issues.  4. **Check Dockerfile**:    - Ensure that your Dockerfile does not contain any errors or misconfigurations that could be causing the scan to fail.  5. **Run Trivy Scan Manually**:    - Try running Trivy directly on the command line to see if you can reproduce the error outside of the build process:    ```bash    trivy docker-image-name --ignore-unfixed    ```    - This can help identify if the issue is related to your build configuration or the scan itself.  6. **Enable Debug Logs**:    - Increase the logging level to DEBUG for Trivy to gather more detailed information about what might be going wrong:    ```bash    trivy docker-image-name --verbose    ```    - Analyze the logs for any error messages or warnings that might indicate the root cause of the failure.  7. **Check for Network Issues**:    - Trivy needs to communicate with its databases over the network to perform vulnerability scans. Ensure that there are no network restrictions or firewalls blocking this communication.  8. **Update Trivy and Dependencies**:    - Make sure that both Trivy and your dependencies (like Docker, Git, etc.) are up-to-date. Sometimes, issues are resolved in newer versions of these tools.    ```bash    sudo apt update && sudo apt install trivy  # For Ubuntu    ```  9. **Consult Documentation and Community**:    - If none of the above steps resolve the issue, consult the official Trivy documentation and community forums for more guidance or potential bug reports related to the error youâ€™re experiencing.  By following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and potentially fix the issues with your Trivy scan failing during the build process. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the support channels provided by your CI/CD platform or the Trivy community for further assistance.",

         "I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely?",
         "Managing secrets like API keys or access tokens securely in a React web application is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Here are some best practices for securing secrets:  ### 1. **Use Environment Variables** Store sensitive information like secrets in environment variables rather than hardcoding them into your React code. This way, you can switch between environments (development, staging, production) without changing code.  #### Steps: - **Set Environment Variables:**   - On **Docker**, you can use `.env` files:     ```plaintext     API_KEY=your-api-key     ```   - On **CI/CD** tools like CircleCI, GitHub Actions, etc., define these variables.    - **Access Environment Variables in React:**   - Use `react-dotenv` or similar libraries to load environment variables from `.env` files.   - Example with `react-dotenv`:     ```javascript     import dotenv from 'dotenv';      dotenv.config();      export default function App() {       const apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY;       return (         <div>           <h1>Secrets Management</h1>           <p>API Key: {apiKey}</p>         </div>       );     }     ```  ### 2. **Securely Store Secrets During Deployment** Ensure that secrets are never exposed during deployment or runtime.  #### Steps: - **Avoid Committing Secrets Directly:**   - Never commit sensitive information to your source control (Git).   - Tools like GitLab, GitHub, etc., allow you to configure secrets to be used during builds.  - **Use External Secrets Management Services:**   - Consider services like **Vault**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, or **Azure Key Vault**.   - Integrate these services to store and manage secrets securely.  ### 3. **Encrypt Sensitive Data at Rest** If you store data locally, ensure it's encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.  ### 4. **Minimize Exposure** - **Limit Access:** Ensure that only necessary team members have access to sensitive information. - **Regular Audits:** Regularly review access controls and audit logs to detect any suspicious activities.  ### 5. **Use Secure Communication Protocols** Ensure that all data transmitted between your application and backend services uses secure protocols like HTTPS.  By following these best practices, you can significantly improve the security posture of your React application and manage sensitive information effectively. Always stay updated with the latest security guidelines and keep your tools and frameworks patched against known vulnerabilities.",
         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it.

         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

         "How do I restrict my API so that only admins can see it?",
         "To restrict your API so that only admins can access it, you can implement API access control using various mechanisms provided by Choreo. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:  1. **Set Up User Management**:    - Ensure that user management is set up in your organization. This includes creating roles and assigning users to these roles.  2. **Create Admin Role**:    - Create an \"admin\" role if it doesn't already exist.      ```plaintext      Navigate to Settings -> Users & Roles -> Roles -> Create Role -> Assign users to this role      ```  3. **Define API Access Policies**:    - Use the API access policies in Choreo to define who can access the API.  4. **Implement Authentication and Authorization**:    - Configure an authentication mechanism like OAuth 2.0 and ensure that only admin users are granted admin tokens or scopes.  5. **Set API Access Permissions**:    - Go to the API definition and configure the security policy.    - Select OAuth 2.0 and add necessary scopes.  Here are the detailed steps:  ### Step-by-Step Guide  #### 1. Create an Admin Role 1. Navigate to `Settings` > `Users & Roles` > `Roles`. 2. Click on `Create Role`. 3. Give the role a name, e.g., `Admin`. 4. Add necessary users to the role.  #### 2. Configure API Security Policy 1. Go to the API you want to secure. 2. Navigate to `Settings` > `Security Policy`. 3. Under the `OAuth 2.0` tab, enable OAuth 2.0. 4. Define the required scopes for accessing the API. 5. Assign the role `Admin` to those scopes.  #### 3. Generate Admin Tokens 1. Create a client (application) in your OAuth 2.0 provider (if not already done). 2. Assign the appropriate scope to the client that matches the one defined for admin access. 3. Generate a token using the admin client credentials. 4. Ensure only authorized admins can generate such tokens.  ### Example: Using OAuth 2.0 with Choreo  ```plaintext 1. Create Roles:    - Navigate to Settings -> Users & Roles -> Roles.    - Create a role named 'Admin' and assign users to it.  2. Configure API Security:    - For the API:      - Navigate to the API settings.      - Under Security Policy -> OAuth 2.0, enable OAuth 2.0.      - Define scopes and assign the 'Admin' role to those scopes.  3. Generate Admin Tokens:    - Use a tool or script to request an OAuth 2.0 token using the admin client ID and secret.    - Only allow tokens that have the 'admin' scope.  Example API Security Configuration in Choreo: https://docs.choreo.wso2.com/en/latest/user-guide/settings/security-policies-oauth-2.0.html ```  By following these steps, you can ensure that only users with the admin role can access your API, thereby restricting its visibility and usage to admins only.",

         "How do I configure my applications to scale automatically?",
         "Scaling applications automatically typically involves a combination of configuring your applications and setting up auto-scaling policies within your environment. While Choreo itself does not directly handle scaling services and applications, you can integrate it with infrastructure-as-code tools and cloud providers that support auto-scaling.  Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to configuring auto-scaling for your applications, integrating them with Choreo:  ### 1. Identify the Environment and Tools - **Cloud Provider**: Determine if you are using Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, or another cloud provider. - **Orchestration Tool**: Consider whether you will use Kubernetes or another orchestration tool.  ### 2. Configure Auto-Scaling in the Cloud Provider If you are using a cloud provider like AWS:  #### For AWS: 1. **Enable Auto Scaling**:    - Go to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.    - Navigate to `Auto Scaling Groups` and click `Create Auto Scaling Group`.    - Define the launch configuration, specify instance types, and set the minimum and maximum number of instances.    - Set scaling policies based on metrics such as CPU utilization, network bytes sent, or requests per second.    - Save the configuration.  2. **Configure Metrics**:    - In the Auto Scaling dashboard, create alarms based on custom or built-in metrics. These alarms trigger scaling actions.    - Use CloudWatch to monitor these metrics.  ### Integrating with Choreo Choreo itself doesnâ€™t handle auto-scaling. However, you can automate the process by triggering workflows or actions in Choreo when auto-scaling events occur.  1. **Create Webhooks**:    - In Choreo, create a new Webhook to capture auto-scaling events from the cloud provider.    - Example scenario: Set up a webhook in Choreo that triggers when an alarm is triggered (indicating a need for scaling).  2. **Set Up Workflows**:    - Design a workflow in Choreo to perform actions when a webhook is triggered (e.g., create or delete services, update API configurations).    - Use conditions and loops to automate the scaling logic based on the received event data.  ### Example Workflow in Choreo 1. **Create a Webhook**:    ```plaintext    Settings > Integration Types > Webhooks > Create New    ```    - Configure the webhook to capture metrics from CloudWatch or other monitoring services.  2. **Define Actions in Workflow**:    ```plaintext    Workflows > Create a New Workflow    ```    - Add steps to handle the incoming data (e.g., parse metrics, decide on scaling action).    - Use actions to trigger scaling in your application (e.g., increase/decrease number of pods in Kubernetes).  ### Example Scenario 1. **Webhook Trigger**:    - Webhook triggered by an alarm from CloudWatch.     2. **Workflow Logic**:    ```plaintext    - If CPU usage exceeds threshold, create new Kubernetes pod(s).    - If CPU usage drops below threshold, terminate unnecessary pods.    ```  ### Documentation Links - **Auto-Scaling in AWS**: [AWS Auto Scaling Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html) - **Webhooks in Choreo**: [Choreo Webhook Guide](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CHE/Creating+Webhooks)  By following these steps, you can effectively configure your applications to scale automatically and integrate this capability with Choreo workflows to manage and control scaling operations programmatically.",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "My service gets overloaded with requests how to fix this?",
         "Overloading can be addressed through several strategies in Choreo, including managing traffic and configuring scaling policies. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:  ### 1. Use Traffic Management Traffic management helps you control the amount of incoming traffic to your service. You can set limits on the number of requests or use throttling mechanisms to prevent overwhelming your service.  #### Steps to Configure Traffic Management: - **Set Traffic Ratelimit**:   - Navigate to the \"Services\" section in Choreo.   - Select the service experiencing high traffic.   - Go to the \"Actions\" tab.   - Click on \"Create Action\".   - Under \"Action Type\", choose \"Rate Limit\" and configure it according to your needs (e.g., 100 requests per minute).    - **Use Quotas**:   - Go to the \"Settings\" tab of the service.   - Configure \"Request Quotas\" under \"Throttle Policies\" if necessary.  - **Implement Throttling Policies**:   - Go to the \"Actions\" tab and create throttling actions based on user-defined criteria.  ### 2. Utilize External Load Balancers If you are using external load balancers, ensure they are configured properly to distribute traffic efficiently.  ### 3. Implement Scalability Policies Automatically scale your service resources based on traffic demand to handle spikes in requests without manual intervention.  #### Steps to Configure Scaling: - **Define Scale Rules**:   - Go to the \"Settings\" tab of your service.   - Under \"Scale Rules\", define rules based on CPU usage, memory consumption, etc.  - **Configure Automated Scaling**:   - Define thresholds for scaling up and down. For example, if CPU usage exceeds 70%, increase resources; when it falls below 50%, decrease resources.  ### 4. Monitor Service Performance Regularly monitor your service's performance to catch and address potential issues early.  #### Steps for Monitoring: - **Use Observability Tools**:   - Enable and utilize built-in monitoring tools provided by Choreo to track service health.   - Check \"Metrics\" under \"Overview\" for real-time statistics.  - **Set Up Alerts**:   - Configure alerts to notify you when critical metrics like response time or errors exceed predefined thresholds.  ### Documentation References - [Choreo Traffic Management](https://wso2.com/resources/articles/guide-to-wso2-micro-integrator-and-traffic-management/) - [Choreo Scale Rules Configuration](https://wso2.com/resources/articles/configuring-scale-rules-in-wso2-api-manager/)  By implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage and mitigate the impact of high traffic on your services in Choreo.",
         "Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu.

Expand the Rate Limiting section under Manage. Select a Rate Limiting Level and click Apply. Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count. For API Proxy components, the process differs slightly. After step 2, click the settings icon next to API Configuration and proceed directly to selecting the Rate Limiting Level.",

    "\"To add environment variables to a Python web application in the context of Choreo (an iPaaS tool), you would typically configure environment variables at the deployment stage rather than within the Python code itself. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:  1. **Define Environment Variables in Choreo:**    - Log in to your Choreo account.    - Navigate to the workspace where you have deployed or plan to deploy your Python web application.    - Use the `Variables` section of Choreo to define the environment variables required by your application.  2. **Use the Variables in Your Python Code:**    - In your Python web application, you can access these environment variables using common Python methods.   Here is an example of how to do this:  ### Step 1: Define Environment Variables in Choreo  1. Go to the `Variables` tab under the `Design` or `Deploy` section of your Python web app in Choreo. 2. Add the required environment variables. For example:    ```plaintext    - Variable Name: DATABASE_URI    - Variable Value: postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname    ```    Repeat this step for each environment variable needed by your application.  ### Step 2: Access Environment Variables in Python  Once the variables are defined in Choreo, you can access them in your Python code as follows:  ```python from dotenv import load_dotenv import os  # Load environment variables from Choreo into .env file load_dotenv()  DATABASE_URI = os.getenv('DATABASE_URI') SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY') ```  Alternatively, if you prefer not to use a `.env` file, you can directly access the variables using the following approach:  ```python import os  DATABASE_URI = os.getenv('DATABASE_URI', 'default_value') SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'default_secret_key') ```  ### Step 3: Ensure Variables are Available at Runtime  - Make sure the environment variables are available when the application starts. This is usually managed by Choreo's deployment mechanism.  By following these steps, you ensure that your Python web application has access to the necessary environment variables, which can be easily managed and updated through Choreoâ€™s configuration interface.\",\n",
    "\"Connecting a React frontend to a backend can be done through various methods, including HTTP requests. Choreo provides a robust environment to manage APIs, which can be used as the backend endpoint from your React application. Below are the steps to set up a connection:  ### Step 1: Expose Your Backend Service as an API in Choreo  1. **Log into Choreo:**    - Go to [Choreo](https://choreo.wso2.com/) and log in to your account.  2. **Create an API:**    - Navigate to the â€œAPIsâ€ section and create a new API or select an existing one that will serve as the backend.    - If you have an existing backend, you might need to expose it as an API via a Gateway like WSO2 API Manager or configure it directly in Choreo if supported.  3. **Define API Details:**    - Set the `Provider` and `Consumer`.    - Define the `Resource Paths` and `HTTP Methods` for your API.    - Set up `Authentication`, `Rate Limiting`, and any other necessary settings.  4. **Publish the API:**    - Once everything is set, publish the API to make it available.  ### Step 2: Configure Axios in Your React Application  Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests in JavaScript applications.  1. **Install Axios:**    ```sh    npm install axios    ```  2. **Import Axios in Your React Component:**     ```javascript    import axios from 'axios';     function fetchData() {      axios.get('YOUR_API_URL_HERE')        .then(response => {          console.log('Data:', response.data);        })        .catch(error => {          console.error('Error:', error);        });    }     // Example usage:    fetchData();    ```  3. **Replace `YOUR_API_URL_HERE` with the URL of the API endpoint in Choreo.**  4. **Set Up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**    - If you are facing CORS issues, you may need to configure CORS in your Choreo API or use proxy settings in your React application.  5. **Authentication (Optional):**    - If your API requires authentication, you can pass the token in the headers of the request.    ```javascript    axios.get('YOUR_API_URL_HERE', {      headers: {        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'      }    })    ```  6. **Example of Making a POST Request with Headers:**     ```javascript    async function postData(data) {      const config = {        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }      };       const response = await axios.post('YOUR_API_URL_HERE', data, config);      return response.data;    }    ```  ### Step 3: Test Your Connection  1. **Run Your React Application:**    ```sh    npm start    ```  2. **Invoke Your Backend API:**    - Use the console or an HTTP client like Postman to test the API endpoint.  3. **Check Logs and Console Output:**    - Check the console output for any errors or success messages.  By following these steps, you should be able to successfully connect your React frontend to a backend service configured in Choreo.

    "\"It seems like there might be some confusion regarding adding configuration files to a React web app. React itself is a frontend JavaScript library, and it does not directly manage backend integrations or configuration files. However, if your goal is to manage configurations in a way that works well with a backend (or services) integrated with your React application, you can use the following approaches:  ### 1. **Environment Variables** For managing configuration variables that can vary between environments (development, staging, production), you can use environment variables. This method allows you to store sensitive information such as API keys or database credentials without hardcoding them into your React code.  #### Steps to set up environment variables in a React app:  - **Create Environment Variables File:**   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your React project. For example:   ```   API_KEY=myapikey   DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017   ```  - **Access Environment Variables in Code:**   In your React components, you can access these variables using `process.env`:   ```jsx   import React from 'react';    function App() {     return (       <div>         <h1>Welcome to the App</h1>         <p>The API key is: {process.env.REACT_APP_API_KEY}</p>       </div>     );   }    export default App;   ```    Note: Ensure that `REACT_APP_` prefix is used before any variable name starting with uppercase letters in `.env` files.  ### 2. **External Configuration Files (Optional)** If you need more complex configuration settings (like JSON objects), you can create a JSON file and use it in your React app. However, this is not a recommended practice for sensitive data. Consider using environment variables for sensitive information.  #### Steps to use a JSON configuration file:  - **Create Config File:**   ```json   // config.json   {     \\\"api\\\": {       \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://api.example.com\\\"     },     \\\"database\\\": {       \\\"url\\\": \\\"mongodb://localhost:27017\\\"     }   }   ```  - **Read the File in Your React App:**   ```javascript   import React from 'react';   import fs from 'fs';   import path from 'path';    const configPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'config.json');   let config;    try {     config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(configPath, 'utf8'));   } catch (error) {     console.error('Failed to load config:', error);   }    function App() {     return (       <div>         <h1>Welcome to the App</h1>         <p>The API URL is: {config.api.url}</p>       </div>     );   }    export default App;   ```  ### 3. **Integrating with Backend Services** If your React app needs to interact with backend services or integrations (which might be managed by Choreo), you would typically use APIs provided by those services.  - **Using APIs in React:**   ```jsx   import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';    function App() {     const [data, setData] = useState(null);      useEffect(() => {       fetch('/api/data') // Assume '/api/data' is an endpoint provided by your backend service         .then(response => response.json())         .then(data => setData(data))         .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));     }, []);      return (       <div>         <h1>Welcome to the App</h1>         <p>Data fetched from backend: {data ? JSON.stringify(data) : 'Loading...'}</p>       </div>     );   }    export default App;   ```  This approach ensures that you can dynamically configure your application through external services integrated via Choreo or through environment variables, keeping your code clean and secure.  For more detailed information on managing configurations in React applications, you might want to refer to the official React documentation on [Working with Environment Variables](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-config/).\",\n",

    "\"Scaling applications automatically typically involves a combination of configuring your applications and setting up auto-scaling policies within your environment. While Choreo itself does not directly handle scaling services and applications, you can integrate it with infrastructure-as-code tools and cloud providers that support auto-scaling.  Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to configuring auto-scaling for your applications, integrating them with Choreo:  ### 1. Identify the Environment and Tools - **Cloud Provider**: Determine if you are using Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, or another cloud provider. - **Orchestration Tool**: Consider whether you will use Kubernetes or another orchestration tool.  ### 2. Configure Auto-Scaling in the Cloud Provider If you are using a cloud provider like AWS:  #### For AWS: 1. **Enable Auto Scaling**:    - Go to the EC2 Dashboard in the AWS Management Console.    - Navigate to `Auto Scaling Groups` and click `Create Auto Scaling Group`.    - Define the launch configuration, specify instance types, and set the minimum and maximum number of instances.    - Set scaling policies based on metrics such as CPU utilization, network bytes sent, or requests per second.    - Save the configuration.  2. **Configure Metrics**:    - In the Auto Scaling dashboard, create alarms based on custom or built-in metrics. These alarms trigger scaling actions.    - Use CloudWatch to monitor these metrics.  ### Integrating with Choreo Choreo itself doesnâ€™t handle auto-scaling. However, you can automate the process by triggering workflows or actions in Choreo when auto-scaling events occur.  1. **Create Webhooks**:    - In Choreo, create a new Webhook to capture auto-scaling events from the cloud provider.    - Example scenario: Set up a webhook in Choreo that triggers when an alarm is triggered (indicating a need for scaling).  2. **Set Up Workflows**:    - Design a workflow in Choreo to perform actions when a webhook is triggered (e.g., create or delete services, update API configurations).    - Use conditions and loops to automate the scaling logic based on the received event data.  ### Example Workflow in Choreo 1. **Create a Webhook**:    ```plaintext    Settings > Integration Types > Webhooks > Create New    ```    - Configure the webhook to capture metrics from CloudWatch or other monitoring services.  2. **Define Actions in Workflow**:    ```plaintext    Workflows > Create a New Workflow    ```    - Add steps to handle the incoming data (e.g., parse metrics, decide on scaling action).    - Use actions to trigger scaling in your application (e.g., increase/decrease number of pods in Kubernetes).  ### Example Scenario 1. **Webhook Trigger**:    - Webhook triggered by an alarm from CloudWatch.     2. **Workflow Logic**:    ```plaintext    - If CPU usage exceeds threshold, create new Kubernetes pod(s).    - If CPU usage drops below threshold, terminate unnecessary pods.    ```  ### Documentation Links - **Auto-Scaling in AWS**: [AWS Auto Scaling Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/what-is-amazon-ec2-auto-scaling.html) - **Webhooks in Choreo**: [Choreo Webhook Guide](https://docs.wso2.com/display/CHE/Creating+Webhooks)  By following these steps, you can effectively configure your applications to scale automatically and integrate this capability with Choreo workflows to manage and control scaling operations programmatically.\",\n",

         "How to add authentication to my service?",
         "To add authentication to a service in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature, which simplifies the integration of authentication and authorization into your web applications. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### 1. Enable Choreo's Managed Authentication\nChoreo's managed authentication is specifically designed for single-page applications (SPAs) built with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. This feature handles the complexities of OIDC/OAuth 2.0 protocols for you.\n\n### 2. Configure the Identity Provider\nYou can configure your web application to work with Choreo's built-in identity provider or any external identity provider that supports OIDC/OAuth 2.0. \n\n### 3. Add Connection Configuration\nFor SPAs, you need to add the connection configuration as a file mount:\n\n- **Mount a Configuration File**: You can mount a file (like `config.js`) in the **Configurations** pane on the **Deploy** page. The configuration file should contain the service URL as shown below:\n\n    ```yaml\n    window.configs = {\n        apiUrl: '<SERVICE_URL>',\n    };\n    ```\n\n- **Reference the Configuration File**: Ensure the `config.js` file is accessible in your `index.html` file:\n\n    ```html\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=en>\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=utf-8 />\n        <title>My React App</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=root></div>\n        <script src=/public/config.js></script>\n    </body>\n    </html>\n    ```\n\n### 4. Handling Authentication in Your Application\nAfter adding the configuration, you can read it in your application:\n\n```javascript\nconst serviceURL = window?.configs?.apiUrl ? window.configs.apiUrl : /;\n```\n\nIf using Choreo-managed authentication, the security handshakes will be handled automatically during deployment, allowing you to directly call the service:\n\n```javascript\nconst response = await axios.get(`${serviceURL}/{RESOURCE_PATH}`);\n```\n\n### 5. Using External Identity Providers\nIf you opt to use an external identity provider, you will need to obtain an access token and include it in your HTTP requests. This involves fetching the token and managing its expiration and refresh within your application.\n\n### Additional Security Features\nChoreo's managed authentication follows the backend for frontend (BFF) architecture, ensuring security from potential attacks. It is also recommended to use modern browsers that support the 'SAMESITE' cookie attribute to prevent CSRF attacks.\n\nYou can find more detailed information on setting up managed authentication in Choreo from the following documentation links:\n- [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/)\n- [Use a Connection in Your Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-web-application/) \n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively add authentication to your service in Choreo.",
         "To add **authentication** to a service in **Choreo**, you can utilize **Choreo's managed authentication** or configure **custom authentication**. Here are the steps for integrating managed authentication and custom authentication:\n\n**Managed Authentication**\nManaged authentication is a feature provided by **Choreo** that simplifies the process of adding authentication and authorization to your web application. It supports web applications created with **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js** buildpacks.\n\n**Steps to Implement Managed Authentication:**\n\n1. **Implement Sign-in Functionality:**\n```<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = /auth/login }}>Login</button>```\nThis redirects users to the **login path** where **Choreo** handles the authentication process.\n\n2. **Obtain User Information Claims:**\n\n**Via Cookie:**\n```import Cookies from 'js-cookie';\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));\nCookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' });```\n\n**Via GET Endpoint:**\n```const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');```\n\n3. **Implement Sign-out Functionality:**\n```<button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`;}}>Logout</button>```\n\n4. **Invoke APIs:**\n```const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>');```\n\n**Custom Authentication**\nIf you prefer to handle authentication manually or use custom authentication mechanisms, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Steps to Implement Custom Authentication:**\n\n1. **Add the Connection Configuration:**\n```window.configs = {\napiUrl: '<SERVICE_URL>',\nconsumerKey: '<CONSUMER_KEY>',\nconsumerSecret: '<CONSUMER_SECRET>',\ntokenUrl: '<TOKEN_URL>',\n};```\n\n2. **Read the Configuration:**\n```const serviceURL = window?.configs?.apiUrl ? window.configs.apiUrl : /;```\n\n3. **Acquire an OAuth 2.0 Access Token:**\n\n**Using a cURL Command:**\n```CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key\nCONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret\nTOKEN_URL=your_token_url\nCLIENT_CREDENTIALS=$(echo -n $CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET | base64)\ncurl -X POST $TOKEN_URL \n-H Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded \n-H Authorization: Basic $CLIENT_CREDENTIALS \n--data-urlencode grant_type=client_credentials```\n\n4. **Invoke the Service:**\n```const response = await axios.get(serviceURL/{RESOURCE_PATH}, {\nheaders: {\n'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`\n}\n});```\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully add **authentication** to your service in **Choreo** using either **managed authentication** or **custom authentication** methods.",

         "How to connect the React frontend to the backend?",
         "To connect a React frontend application to a backend service using Choreo, you can follow these steps that outline the integration process:\n\n### Step 1: Add the Connection Configuration\n1. **Create a Configuration File**: For single-page applications (SPAs) like React, you need to create a configuration file (for example, `config.js`) and mount it via the **Configurations** pane on the **Deploy** page. The configuration should include the service URL. A sample configuration could look like this:\n ```yaml\n window.configs = {\n apiUrl: '<SERVICE_URL>',\n };\n ```\n \n2. **Reference the Configuration File**: To ensure your React app can access this configuration at runtime, include a script tag in your `index.html` file:\n ```html\n <!DOCTYPE html>\n <html lang=en>\n <head>\n <meta charset=utf-8 />\n <title>My React App</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <div id=root></div>\n <script src=/public/config.js></script>\n </body>\n </html>\n ```\n\n### Step 2: Read the Configuration\nIn your React components, you can read the configurations set in the `config.js` file. For instance, to access the API URL, you can use:\n```javascript\nconst serviceURL = window?.configs?.apiUrl ? window.configs.apiUrl : /;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Invoke the Service\nIf you are using Choreo-managed authentication, Choreo will handle authentication for you. You can call the backend service directly using your preferred HTTP client. Here’s an example using Axios:\n```javascript\nconst response = await axios.get(`${serviceURL}/{RESOURCE_PATH}`);\n```\nMake sure to replace `{RESOURCE_PATH}` with the actual path of the resource you want to access.\n\n### Authentication Considerations\nIf you are using Choreo-managed authentication, it simplifies the authentication process, allowing you to connect without dealing with complex security protocols. However, if you are using an external identity provider (IdP), ensure you obtain an access token and include it in the HTTP authorization header, as follows:\n```javascript\nconst response = await axios.get(`${serviceURL}/{RESOURCE_PATH}`, {\n headers: {\n 'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`\n }\n});\n```\n\n### Summary\nBy following these steps, you can successfully connect your React frontend application to a backend service in Choreo. You can manage the connection configurations, secure the service calls, and handle authentication seamlessly.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Use a Connection in Your Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-web-application/)\n- [Deploy a Web Application that Consumes a Backend Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/quick-start-guides/deploy-a-web-application-that-consumes-a-backend-service/)",

         "To resolve the 'Procfile not found' error for a Python service in Choreo, you need to ensure that a `Procfile` is correctly set up in the root directory of your project. The `Procfile` is essential as it declares the commands that run your application's containers, and in the case of Python projects, it is mandatory to include a `web` process type.\n\nHere are the steps to correctly set up or include a `Procfile` for deployment:\n\n1. **Create a Procfile:**\n - In the root directory of your Python service project, create a file named `Procfile` (without any file extension).\n\n2. **Define the Web Process:**\n - In the `Procfile`, you need to specify the command that starts your application. The format should be:\n ```\n web: <command to start your application>\n ```\n - Here are some example commands you can use:\n - If you are using Flask, you could write:\n ```\n web: flask run --host=0.0.0.0\n ```\n - If you are using Gunicorn, you could write:\n ```\n web: gunicorn --bind :8080 --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 0 main:app\n ```\n - If you are simply running a Python script, you might use:\n ```\n web: python main.py\n ```\n\n3. **Check the Placement:**\n - Ensure that the `Procfile` is located in the root directory of your project, where your main application files are located. This is crucial for Choreo to detect it correctly during deployment.\n\n4. **Deploy Your Service:**\n - After configuring your `Procfile`, proceed to deploy your service through the Choreo Console. If the `Procfile` is set up correctly, the deployment should proceed without the 'Procfile not found' error.\n\nFor further details and examples, you can refer to the official documentation here: [Deploy an Application with Buildpacks](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-an-application-with-buildpacks/#develop-a-component).",

         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open Your Component**: In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to configure the readiness probe.\n\n2. **Navigate to Health Checks**: In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then select **Health Checks**.\n\n3. **Create a New Probe**: On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create** to start configuring your probes.\n\n4. **Configure the Readiness Probe**: \n - Input the necessary configuration details for the readiness probe according to your application's requirements.\n - It's important to note that readiness probes run periodically and help determine if your container is ready to receive traffic. If the readiness probe fails, the container will not receive network traffic.\n\n5. **Save Your Configuration**: After configuring the readiness probe, click **Save** to apply the changes.\n\n6. **Monitor Your Container**: You can verify that the container works as expected by checking the **Runtime** section under **DevOps**. If the container does not start as anticipated, you may need to review the events and conditions that might indicate a probe failure.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- Be cautious when configuring readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application will stop receiving traffic, and it may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and causes a restart.\n\n### Additional Probe Types:\nYou can configure different types of probes for your readiness checks:\n- **HTTP GET Request**: Sends a request to a specified endpoint (recommended to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint).\n- **TCP Connection Probe**: Attempts to establish a TCP connection on the specified port.\n- **Execute a Command**: Runs a command inside the container and checks the return status.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation here: [Configure liveness and readiness probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-liveness-and-readiness-probes).",

In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

This may involve updating libraries or dependencies in your project that are causing the vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Using `.trivyignore`**: If you cannot immediately fix a critical CVE, you have the option to ignore it temporarily. To do this, you need to create a `.trivyignore` file and add it to the Docker build context path when creating the component. The file should contain the CVEs you want to ignore, one per line. For example:\n ```\n CVE-2023-xxxx\n CVE-2023-yyyy\n # comments can be added like this\n ```\n\n4. **Rebuild the Component**: After addressing the vulnerabilities or adding the `.trivyignore` file, you will need to rebuild your component to apply the changes. \n\n5. **Troubleshooting Specific Error Codes**: Be aware of specific error codes related to Trivy vulnerabilities during the integration component build, such as:\n - **123**: Trivy security vulnerabilities found in the `libs` directory.\n - **124**: Trivy security vulnerabilities found in the `dropins` directory.\n - **125**: Trivy security vulnerabilities found in either the `libs` or `dropins` directory.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve Trivy security check errors in your Choreo deployments effectively.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Troubleshoot errors in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-the-micro-integrator-runtime-version-in-your-integration-project/#troubleshoot-errors)\n- [Deploy the containerized component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-a-containerized-application/#deploy-the-containerized-component)",
         "To resolve Trivy security check errors in Choreo, you can follow these steps: Identify the Vulnerabilities: Review the Trivy Scan Results: During the deployment process, Choreo uses Trivy to scan for vulnerabilities. If critical vulnerabilities are found, the deployment process will halt. The Trivy scan status and any security failures are displayed in the deployment pane. Click on the Library (Trivy) vulnerable scan step to view the details of the vulnerabilities. Fix the Vulnerabilities: Fix the Identified Vulnerabilities: The best approach to resolving these errors is to address the identified vulnerabilities in your code or dependencies. Update or replace the vulnerable libraries with their secure versions. Ignore the Vulnerabilities (Temporarily): Create a .trivyignore File: If you cannot fix a critical CVE immediately, you can choose to ignore the vulnerability by creating a .trivyignore file. Add the .trivyignore file to your Docker build context path. For example, {buildContextPath}/.trivyignore. In the .trivyignore file, list the CVEs you want to ignore, one per line: CVE-2023-xxxx CVE-2023-yyyy CVE-2023-xxxx Redeploy the Component: Rebuild and Redeploy the Component: After fixing or ignoring the vulnerabilities: Rebuild your component by triggering a new build in the Builds pane.",

         "To add a configuration file to a React web app in Choreo, you will follow a series of steps to ensure that your configuration is correctly integrated and accessible within your application. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to do this:\n\n### Steps to Add a Configuration File to a React Web App\n\n1. **Create the Configuration File**:\n - Navigate to the `public` directory of your React application.\n - Create a new file named `config.js`. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example:\n ```javascript\n window.config = {\n apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',\n featureFlags: {\n enableNewFeature: true,\n enableExperimentalFeature: false,\n },\n };\n ```\n\n2. **Include the Configuration File in your HTML**:\n - Open the `index.html` file located in the `public` directory.\n - Add a `<script>` tag to include the `config.js` file inside the `<body>` tag:\n ```html\n <!DOCTYPE html>\n <html lang=en>\n <head>\n <meta charset=utf-8 />\n <title>My React App</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n <div id=root></div>\n <script src=%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js></script>\n </body>\n </html>\n ```\n\n3. **Access the Configuration in Your React Components**:\n - In your React component, you can access the configuration variables through the `window.config` object. For example:\n ```javascript\n import React from 'react';\n\n function MyComponent() {\n const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl;\n const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature;\n const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature;\n\n // Use these variables as needed in your component.\n }\n ```\n\n4. **Deploy Your Component**:\n - When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that you create a config file mount that points to the path where your `config.js` file is expected to be. This ensures that the file is accessible at runtime.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- **Security**: Be cautious with the data you include in `config.js`. Do not expose sensitive information as anything you mount will be available to users in the browser.\n- **File Mounts**: If you're using Choreo's deployment features, make sure to create the necessary file mounts in the Choreo console to ensure that the `config.js` file is included during deployment.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/build-and-deploy-a-single-page-web-application/#manage-runtime-configurations-for-web-applications).",

For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it.

         "How can I secure my web app?",
         "To secure your web application using Choreo, you can leverage best practices and tools provided by Choreo's managed authentication system. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n### Best Practices for Securing Web Applications\n\n1. **Implement Managed Authentication**:\n - Use Choreo's managed authentication to handle sign-in and sign-out processes. This simplifies adding authentication and authorization to your web application without dealing with the complexities of OIDC/OAuth2.0 protocols.\n\n2. **Use Secure Authentication Patterns**:\n - Follow the backend for frontend (BFF) architecture, which ensures that OAuth tokens remain secure and are not exposed to potential attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS).\n\n3. **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Cookies**:\n - Store user information securely and avoid keeping sensitive data in cookies. Use the `userinfo` cookie established by managed authentication, which is short-lived, to minimize security risks.\n\n4. **Handle Session Expiry**:\n - Implement logic to handle session expiry. When a session exceeds the configured expiry time, automatically redirect users to the login page if they attempt to access secured resources.\n\n5. **Custom Error Handling**:\n - Set up custom error pages to handle authentication errors gracefully. This ensures users are informed of issues without exposing sensitive details.\n\n6. **Use HTTPS**:\n - Always use secure protocols (HTTPS) to protect the data in transit between the client and server.\n\n7. **Implement Rate Limiting**:\n - Define proper rate limiting for your APIs to prevent abuse and ensure they are not overwhelmed by too many requests.\n\n8. **Follow OWASP Guidelines**:\n - Adhere to OWASP's security recommendations, such as avoiding hardcoded credentials, using short-lived access tokens, and validating all inputs and outputs.\n\n### Tools Available in Choreo\n\n- **Managed Authentication**: Choreo provides built-in features to integrate authentication into your web applications seamlessly.\n- **Identity Provider Configuration**: You can configure an identity provider to handle user authentication and authorization effectively.\n- **Session Management**: Choreo's managed authentication includes features for session management, including session expiry handling.\n- **API Invocations**: Easily invoke APIs within your organization using the built-in functionalities provided by Choreo.\n\nBy implementing these practices and utilizing the available tools, you can enhance the security of your web application effectively.\n\nFor detailed steps on securing web applications with managed authentication in Choreo, you can refer to the documentation: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/).",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component. Using this method you can secure your web application.",

         "How do I set up automatic scaling for my applications?",
         "To configure automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you can utilize the scale-to-zero feature and autoscaling capabilities. Here's how it works:\n\n### Scale-to-Zero\n\n1. **Default Setting**: For service components and web apps created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default. This means that when your application is idle and not receiving HTTP traffic, it will automatically scale down to zero replicas. When a request is received, it scales back up to serve the request.\n\n2. **Manual Configuration for Older Components**: If your components were created before February 23, 2024, you can enable scale-to-zero by following these steps:\n - In the **Component Listing** pane, select your component.\n - Ensure the component is deployed and ready to receive traffic.\n - Navigate to **DevOps** > **Scaling**.\n - For free users, click on the **scale-to-zero** card. For paid users, the process is similar.\n\n3. **Important Notes**:\n - Scale-to-zero will not apply to components with at least one endpoint set to **Project** visibility.\n - It is also restricted for HTTP services running on certain ports (notably, ports 5000, 6000, 7000, etc.).\n - The scale-to-zero service should start within 60 seconds; otherwise, it may timeout.\n\n### Autoscaling Component Replicas\n\nFor paid plans, Choreo allows you to configure autoscaling based on resource consumption:\n\n- **Min and Max Replicas**: You can set a minimum and maximum number of replicas. It is recommended to keep the minimum at 2 for high availability.\n- **Resource Thresholds**: You can define CPU and memory thresholds. If the utilization exceeds these thresholds, Choreo will automatically scale the number of replicas up until the average usage falls below the threshold.\n\n### Configuration Steps\n1. Go to your component in the **Component Listing** pane.\n2. Click on **DevOps** > **Scaling**.\n3. Set your desired parameters for minimum and maximum replicas, as well as CPU and memory thresholds.\n\n### Visuals\nHere are some visuals to help you understand the scaling views:\n- **Free User - Scale to Zero**: \n ![Free User - Scale to Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/scaling/free-user-scaling-view.png)\n \n- **Paid User - Scale to Zero**: \n ![Paid User - Scale to Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/scaling/paid-user-scaling-view.png)\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n\n- [Enable Scale to Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#enable-scale-to-zero)\n- [Autoscale Component Replicas](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-component-replicas/)\n- [How Scale to Zero Works in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#how-scale-to-zero-works-in-choreo)\n\nThese resources will provide you with additional insights and troubleshooting tips if needed.",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "During a Trivy scan in Choreo, a build may fail for several common reasons, primarily related to security vulnerabilities detected in the application components. Here are the key reasons and how to resolve them:\n\n1. **Critical Vulnerabilities Detected**:\n - Trivy scans for security vulnerabilities in the final Docker image during the build process. If any critical vulnerabilities (CVEs) are found, the build will fail.\n - **Resolution**: To address this, you should fix the identified vulnerabilities in your code or dependencies and then rebuild the component. If immediate resolution isn't possible, you can choose to ignore specific vulnerabilities temporarily.\n\n2. **Ignoring Critical CVEs**:\n - If you wish to proceed with the build despite having critical vulnerabilities, you can create a `.trivyignore` file in your Docker build context path. This file allows you to specify which CVEs to ignore during the scan.\n - **Resolution**: Add the CVEs you want to ignore to the `.trivyignore` file, located at `<docker-build-context-path>/.trivyignore`. Each CVE should be listed on a new line, and you can include comments using the `#` symbol.\n\n3. **Vulnerabilities in Specific Directories**:\n - Errors may occur if vulnerabilities are identified specifically in the `libs` or `dropins` directories of your integration project.\n - **Resolution**: Similar to resolving other vulnerabilities, you need to address these issues in your application code or dependencies.\n\n4. **Error Codes Related to Trivy**:\n - The following error codes indicate issues detected during the Trivy scan:\n - **123**: Security vulnerabilities found in the `libs` directory.\n - **124**: Security vulnerabilities found in the `dropins` directory.\n - **125**: Security vulnerabilities found in either the `libs` or `dropins` directory.\n - **Resolution**: Address the vulnerabilities in the respective directories to resolve the build failure.\n\nBy proactively managing and addressing these vulnerabilities, you can successfully pass the Trivy scan and complete your build process.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Troubleshoot component build errors](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/troubleshoot-choreo/#troubleshoot-component-build-errors)\n- [Troubleshoot errors](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-the-micro-integrator-runtime-version-in-your-integration-project/#troubleshoot-errors)\n- [Scan third-party libraries to identify security vulnerabilities](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/work-with-the-micro-integrator-runtime-in-choreo/#scan-third-party-libraries-to-identify-security-vulnerabilities)",

         "I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely?",
         "To securely manage secret keys in a React web application using Choreo, you can utilize the following approaches:\n\n### 1. Use Environment Variables or File Mounts\nChoreo allows you to manage and version your application's configurations and secrets using **environment variables** or **file mounts**. This ensures that sensitive information is not hardcoded into your application code.\n\n- **For Web Applications with Backend:** You can mount runtime configurations and secrets as environment variables or file mounts for a specific environment. \n- **For Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React:** Choreo does not support embedding sensitive secrets directly in the client-side code. Therefore, it's crucial to avoid including any sensitive secrets that are not safe for the browser.\n\n### Example for SPAs\nFor SPAs, you can create a configuration file that includes only non-sensitive runtime variables such as API endpoints, and do not expose any secrets. Here is a brief outline of how to do this:\n\n1. **Create a Configuration File**: \n - Inside your React application, create a `config.js` file in the `public` directory.\n - Populate it with non-sensitive configuration variables:\n ```javascript\n window.config = {\n apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',\n featureFlags: {\n enableNewFeature: true,\n enableExperimentalFeature: false,\n },\n };\n ```\n\n2. **Include Configuration in HTML**: Modify your `index.html` to include this `config.js`:\n ```html\n <script src=%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js></script>\n ```\n\n3. **Access Configurations in React**: In your React components, you can access these configurations through the `window.config` object:\n ```javascript\n const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl;\n ```\n\n4. **Deploy Configurations**: When deploying your application, ensure to create a config file mount in the specified path for each environment, so your React app can access it.\n\n### 2. Secure Storage for Sensitive Secrets\nChoreo securely stores all configurations and secrets in an encrypted secret vault in the cloud. If you're utilizing a private data plane, the configurations and secrets are stored in Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Ensure that you do not expose sensitive information in your React application that can be accessed by users.\n- Regularly manage and rotate your secret keys through the Choreo console.\n\nFor detailed instructions on managing configurations and secrets, visit the [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/) documentation. Additionally, for building and deploying web applications, refer to the [Build and Deploy a Single-Page Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/build-and-deploy-a-single-page-web-application/#manage-runtime-configurations-for-web-applications) documentation.",
         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it.

         "What steps can I take to protect my web app?",
         "To protect a web application in Choreo, you can follow several recommended steps and best practices. Here’s a structured approach to securing your web application:\n\n### 1. Set Up Managed Authentication\nImplement authentication and authorization for your web application using Choreo's managed authentication.\n\n- **Implement Sign-in Functionality**: Create a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path. Use the following code snippet:\n ```javascript\n <button onClick={() => {window.location.href=/auth/login}}>Login</button>\n ```\n- **Obtain User Information Claims**: After sign-in, access user information claims either via a cookie (`userinfo` cookie) or by invoking the `/auth/userinfo` endpoint.\n- **Implement Sign-out Functionality**: Create a sign-out button that redirects users to the `/auth/logout` path using the `session_hint`:\n ```javascript\n <button onClick={async () => {\n window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`;\n }}>Logout</button>\n ```\n\n### 2. Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths\nWhen deploying your web application, ensure that managed authentication is enabled. You can configure the following settings:\n\n- **Post Login Path**: Set the path to redirect users after successful sign-in.\n- **Post Logout Path**: Specify where users are redirected after sign-out.\n- **Error Path**: Define a custom error page for any authentication errors.\n- **Session Expiry Time**: Set an appropriate session expiry time to enhance security.\n\n### 3. Follow OWASP Security Guidelines\nAdhere to the OWASP security guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities:\n\n- **Use Random IDs**: Avoid predictable identifiers; prefer UUIDs.\n- **Avoid Basic Authentication**: Use more secure authentication mechanisms instead of basic auth.\n- **Never Expose API Keys in URLs**: Always pass API keys in headers or cookies, not in the URL.\n- **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect your API from abuse by defining rate limits.\n- **Use HTTPS**: Always serve your application over HTTPS to protect data in transit.\n\n### 4. Manage Access Tokens\nFor JWT access tokens:\n- **Use Short-lived Tokens**: Set a short expiry time (recommended no more than 15 minutes) to reduce the risk if tokens are compromised.\n- **Implement Strong Encryption**: Ensure tokens are securely stored and transmitted.\n\n### 5. Handle Session Expiry Gracefully\nImplement logic in your application to handle `401 Unauthorized` responses by prompting users to re-login.\n\n### 6. Set Up Custom Error Pages\nConfigure a custom error page that users are redirected to in case of authentication errors, ensuring better user experience and security.\n\nBy following these practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your web application on Choreo.\n\nFor detailed steps on setting up managed authentication and enabling it for your web application, you can refer to the documentation here: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-your-web-application) and [OWASP Top 10](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-governance/default-rulesets/owasp_top_10_doc/).",

Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

         "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?",
         "To secure or protect an API in Choreo, you can utilize several methods that focus on authentication and authorization. Here are the primary methods:\n\n1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:\n - RBAC is a flexible and scalable approach to managing access to API resources based on roles assigned to users or groups. Each role determines the permissions granted to perform operations on an API resource. For example, you can define roles such as HR manager who can perform all operations, and HR officer who can only list users. This method allows you to control user access efficiently.\n - For more details on implementing RBAC in Choreo, you can refer to the [RBAC tutorial](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/secure-an-api-with-role-based-access-control/).\n\n2. **Integration with Identity Providers (IdPs)**:\n - Choreo supports integration with external IdPs like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Asgardeo. By configuring these IdPs, you can securely authenticate API invocations.\n - For Azure AD, you can assign scopes to an API and manage authentication through Azure, allowing you to control access based on specific roles or permissions.\n - For Asgardeo, similar steps can be followed to set up API access and manage authentication with scopes.\n - Learn more about integrating with Azure AD [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-azure-ad/) and with Asgardeo [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/).\n\n3. **Choreo Built-In Security Token Service**:\n - Choreo offers a built-in security token service that simplifies API security testing. It allows developers to test APIs with permissions in non-critical environments and manage roles and permissions directly within Choreo. \n - This includes assigning scopes, creating roles, and mapping user groups, which can help ensure that only authorized users can access specific API functions.\n - Detailed steps to test secure API access using Choreo's built-in service can be found [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/).\n\nThese methods collectively enhance the security of APIs in Choreo, ensuring that only authorized users can access and perform actions within your API.",

         "How do I configure my applications to scale automatically?",
         "In Choreo, applications can be configured to scale automatically using the scale-to-zero feature. This feature is particularly beneficial for managing resources efficiently, as it allows your applications to scale down to zero when they are idle and automatically scale up when requests are received.\n\n### Key Features of Scale-to-Zero\n\n1. **Default Behavior**: \n - For service components and web apps created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default.\n - When an application is idle for about 5 minutes, it will automatically scale down to zero. When a new HTTP request is received, it scales up to handle the request.\n\n2. **Manual Configuration for Existing Components**:\n - For components created before February 23, 2024, you need to enable scale-to-zero manually through the Choreo Console.\n - Steps:\n 1. Access the **Component Listing** and select your component.\n 2. Ensure the component is deployed and ready for traffic.\n 3. Navigate to **DevOps** → **Scaling** and enable the **scale-to-zero** feature.\n\n3. **Scaling Limits**:\n - You can set a maximum number of replicas for your application, allowing it to scale up dynamically to meet high traffic demands.\n - If the number of pending requests exceeds a specified threshold (default is 100), Choreo will automatically add a new replica.\n\n4. **Idle Time and Proxy Handling**:\n - When scaled down to zero, an intermediary proxy service holds incoming requests and queues them until the application scales up.\n - The first request after a period of inactivity may experience a delay as the application scales from zero, and this could lead to timeouts in service chains.\n\n5. **Health Checks**:\n - It’s important to fine-tune the readiness probe settings in the **DevOps** → **Health Checks** view to avoid issues like the first request returning a 503 status code.\n\n6. **Use Cases**:\n - The scale-to-zero feature is especially useful in lower environments to reduce infrastructure costs. In production, consider using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for guaranteed high availability.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy configuring the scale-to-zero feature in Choreo, you can ensure that your applications efficiently manage resources while being responsive to incoming traffic. For detailed steps and settings, refer to the documentation: [Autoscale Components with Scale-to-Zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/).",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "My service gets overloaded with requests how to fix this?",
         "To manage high traffic or overload situations for your deployed services in Choreo, you can leverage the **scale-to-zero** feature. This feature automatically adjusts the number of replicas of your services based on the incoming HTTP traffic, ensuring that your applications can handle increased demand without unnecessary resource consumption.\n\n### Here’s how the scale-to-zero feature works:\n\n1. **Automatic Scaling**: When enabled, your services will scale down to zero when there are no incoming HTTP requests. Upon receiving a request, Choreo will create a replica to handle the request, scaling up from zero to one replica. If there are additional requests, it will continue to scale up to the maximum number of replicas you have configured.\n\n2. **Thresholds for Scaling**: You can set a threshold for the number of pending requests that will trigger the spawning of additional replicas. If the number of pending requests exceeds this threshold, Choreo will automatically add new replicas to manage the load.\n\n3. **Idle State**: If the service remains idle for approximately 5 minutes, it will scale back down to zero until a new request arrives.\n\n### Steps to Enable Scale-to-Zero:\n\nFor services created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default. If you are using services created before this date, you can enable it by following these steps:\n\n1. In the Choreo Console, go to the **Component Listing** and select the component you want to scale.\n2. Ensure the component is deployed and ready to receive traffic.\n3. Navigate to the **DevOps** section and click on **Scaling**.\n4. If you are a free or paid user, look for the scale-to-zero card and enable it.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n- The scale-to-zero feature does not apply to services with network visibility set to **Project** or services running on non-supported ports.\n- Ensure that the service is configured to start within 60 seconds, as any delay beyond this will lead to a timeout from the gateway.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation on enabling scale-to-zero: [Enable scale to zero](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#enable-scale-to-zero).\n\nBy utilizing the scale-to-zero capability, you can effectively manage high traffic situations and ensure your services remain responsive without incurring unnecessary costs during low traffic periods.",
         "Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon. Expand the Rate Limiting section under Manage. Select a Rate Limiting Level and click Apply. Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count. For API Proxy components, the process differs slightly. After step 2, click the settings icon next to API Configuration and proceed directly to selecting the Rate Limiting Level.",

    "\"To add authentication to a service in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature, which simplifies the integration of authentication and authorization into your web applications. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\n### 1. Enable Choreo's Managed Authentication\\nChoreo's managed authentication is specifically designed for single-page applications (SPAs) built with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. This feature handles the complexities of OIDC/OAuth 2.0 protocols for you.\\n\\n### 2. Configure the Identity Provider\\nYou can configure your web application to work with Choreo's built-in identity provider or any external identity provider that supports OIDC/OAuth 2.0. \\n\\n### 3. Add Connection Configuration\\nFor SPAs, you need to add the connection configuration as a file mount:\\n\\n- **Mount a Configuration File**: You can mount a file (like `config.js`) in the **Configurations** pane on the **Deploy** page. The configuration file should contain the service URL as shown below:\\n\\n    ```yaml\\n    window.configs = {\\n        apiUrl: '<SERVICE_URL>',\\n    };\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Reference the Configuration File**: Ensure the `config.js` file is accessible in your `index.html` file:\\n\\n    ```html\\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\\n    <html lang=\"\"en\"\">\\n    <head>\\n        <meta charset=\"\"utf-8\"\" />\\n        <title>My React App</title>\\n    </head>\\n    <body>\\n        <div id=\"\"root\"\"></div>\\n        <script src=\"\"/public/config.js\"\"></script>\\n    </body>\\n    </html>\\n    ```\\n\\n### 4. Handling Authentication in Your Application\\nAfter adding the configuration, you can read it in your application:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst serviceURL = window?.configs?.apiUrl ? window.configs.apiUrl : \"\"/\"\";\\n```\\n\\nIf using Choreo-managed authentication, the security handshakes will be handled automatically during deployment, allowing you to directly call the service:\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst response = await axios.get(`${serviceURL}/{RESOURCE_PATH}`);\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Using External Identity Providers\\nIf you opt to use an external identity provider, you will need to obtain an access token and include it in your HTTP requests. This involves fetching the token and managing its expiration and refresh within your application.\\n\\n### Additional Security Features\\nChoreo's managed authentication follows the backend for frontend (BFF) architecture, ensuring security from potential attacks. It is also recommended to use modern browsers that support the 'SAMESITE' cookie attribute to prevent CSRF attacks.\\n\\nYou can find more detailed information on setting up managed authentication in Choreo from the following documentation links:\\n- [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/)\\n- [Use a Connection in Your Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/sharing-and-reusing/use-a-connection-in-your-web-application/) \\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively add authentication to your service in Choreo.\",\n",

    "\"To resolve Trivy security check errors during your Choreo deployments, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Identify Vulnerabilities**: When you deploy your component, Choreo uses Trivy to scan for security vulnerabilities in the Docker image. If any **CRITICAL** vulnerabilities (CVEs) are found, the deployment will be halted. You can view the details of these vulnerabilities in the deployment pane by clicking on the Trivy scan status.\\n\\n2. **Fix the Vulnerabilities**: The recommended approach to resolve Trivy errors is to address the identified vulnerabilities directly. This may involve updating libraries or dependencies in your project that are causing the vulnerabilities.\\n\\n3. **Using `.trivyignore`**: If you cannot immediately fix a critical CVE, you have the option to ignore it temporarily. To do this, you need to create a `.trivyignore` file and add it to the Docker build context path when creating the component. The file should contain the CVEs you want to ignore, one per line. For example:\\n ```\\n CVE-2023-xxxx\\n CVE-2023-yyyy\\n # comments can be added like this\\n ```\\n\\n4. **Rebuild the Component**: After addressing the vulnerabilities or adding the `.trivyignore` file, you will need to rebuild your component to apply the changes. \\n\\n5. **Troubleshooting Specific Error Codes**: Be aware of specific error codes related to Trivy vulnerabilities during the integration component build, such as:\\n - **123**: Trivy security vulnerabilities found in the `libs` directory.\\n - **124**: Trivy security vulnerabilities found in the `dropins` directory.\\n - **125**: Trivy security vulnerabilities found in either the `libs` or `dropins` directory.\\n\\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve Trivy security check errors in your Choreo deployments effectively.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Troubleshoot errors in Choreo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-the-micro-integrator-runtime-version-in-your-integration-project/#troubleshoot-errors)\\n- [Deploy the containerized component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-a-containerized-application/#deploy-the-containerized-component)\",\n",
    "\"To add a configuration file to a React web app in Choreo, you will follow a series of steps to ensure that your configuration is correctly integrated and accessible within your application. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to do this:\\n\\n### Steps to Add a Configuration File to a React Web App\\n\\n1. **Create the Configuration File**:\\n - Navigate to the `public` directory of your React application.\\n - Create a new file named `config.js`. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example:\\n ```javascript\\n window.config = {\\n apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',\\n featureFlags: {\\n enableNewFeature: true,\\n enableExperimentalFeature: false,\\n },\\n };\\n ```\\n\\n2. **Include the Configuration File in your HTML**:\\n - Open the `index.html` file located in the `public` directory.\\n - Add a `<script>` tag to include the `config.js` file inside the `<body>` tag:\\n ```html\\n <!DOCTYPE html>\\n <html lang=\"\"en\"\">\\n <head>\\n <meta charset=\"\"utf-8\"\" />\\n <title>My React App</title>\\n </head>\\n <body>\\n <div id=\"\"root\"\"></div>\\n <script src=\"\"%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js\"\"></script>\\n </body>\\n </html>\\n ```\\n\\n3. **Access the Configuration in Your React Components**:\\n - In your React component, you can access the configuration variables through the `window.config` object. For example:\\n ```javascript\\n import React from 'react';\\n\\n function MyComponent() {\\n const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl;\\n const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature;\\n const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature;\\n\\n // Use these variables as needed in your component.\\n }\\n ```\\n\\n4. **Deploy Your Component**:\\n - When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that you create a config file mount that points to the path where your `config.js` file is expected to be. This ensures that the file is accessible at runtime.\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n\\n- **Security**: Be cautious with the data you include in `config.js`. Do not expose sensitive information as anything you mount will be available to users in the browser.\\n- **File Mounts**: If you're using Choreo's deployment features, make sure to create the necessary file mounts in the Choreo console to ensure that the `config.js` file is included during deployment.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/build-and-deploy-a-single-page-web-application/#manage-runtime-configurations-for-web-applications).\",\n",
    "\"To secure your web application using Choreo, you can leverage best practices and tools provided by Choreo's managed authentication system.

    "\"During a Trivy scan in Choreo, a build may fail for several common reasons, primarily related to security vulnerabilities detected in the application components. Here are the key reasons and how to resolve them:\\n\\n1. **Critical Vulnerabilities Detected**:\\n - Trivy scans for security vulnerabilities in the final Docker image during the build process. If any critical vulnerabilities (CVEs) are found, the build will fail.\\n - **Resolution**: To address this, you should fix the identified vulnerabilities in your code or dependencies and then rebuild the component. If immediate resolution isn't possible, you can choose to ignore specific vulnerabilities temporarily.\\n\\n2. **Ignoring Critical CVEs**:\\n - If you wish to proceed with the build despite having critical vulnerabilities, you can create a `.trivyignore` file in your Docker build context path. This file allows you to specify which CVEs to ignore during the scan.\\n - **Resolution**: Add the CVEs you want to ignore to the `.trivyignore` file, located at `<docker-build-context-path>/.trivyignore`. Each CVE should be listed on a new line, and you can include comments using the `#` symbol.\\n\\n3. **Vulnerabilities in Specific Directories**:\\n - Errors may occur if vulnerabilities are identified specifically in the `libs` or `dropins` directories of your integration project.\\n - **Resolution**: Similar to resolving other vulnerabilities, you need to address these issues in your application code or dependencies.\\n\\n4. **Error Codes Related to Trivy**:\\n - The following error codes indicate issues detected during the Trivy scan:\\n - **123**: Security vulnerabilities found in the `libs` directory.\\n - **124**: Security vulnerabilities found in the `dropins` directory.\\n - **125**: Security vulnerabilities found in either the `libs` or `dropins` directory.\\n - **Resolution**: Address the vulnerabilities in the respective directories to resolve the build failure.\\n\\nBy proactively managing and addressing these vulnerabilities, you can successfully pass the Trivy scan and complete your build process.\\n\\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Troubleshoot component build errors](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/references/troubleshoot-choreo/#troubleshoot-component-build-errors)\\n- [Troubleshoot errors](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/manage-the-micro-integrator-runtime-version-in-your-integration-project/#troubleshoot-errors)\\n- [Scan third-party libraries to identify security vulnerabilities](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/work-with-the-micro-integrator-runtime-in-choreo/#scan-third-party-libraries-to-identify-security-vulnerabilities)\",\n",

    "\"To securely manage secret keys in a React web application using Choreo, you can utilize the following approaches:\\n\\n### 1. Use Environment Variables or File Mounts\\nChoreo allows you to manage and version your application's configurations and secrets using **environment variables** or **file mounts**. This ensures that sensitive information is not hardcoded into your application code.\\n\\n- **For Web Applications with Backend:** You can mount runtime configurations and secrets as environment variables or file mounts for a specific environment. \\n- **For Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React:** Choreo does not support embedding sensitive secrets directly in the client-side code. Therefore, it's crucial to avoid including any sensitive secrets that are not safe for the browser.\\n\\n### Example for SPAs\\nFor SPAs, you can create a configuration file that includes only non-sensitive runtime variables such as API endpoints, and do not expose any secrets. Here is a brief outline of how to do this:\\n\\n1. **Create a Configuration File**: \\n - Inside your React application, create a `config.js` file in the `public` directory.\\n - Populate it with non-sensitive configuration variables:\\n ```javascript\\n window.config = {\\n apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',\\n featureFlags: {\\n enableNewFeature: true,\\n enableExperimentalFeature: false,\\n },\\n };\\n ```\\n\\n2. **Include Configuration in HTML**: Modify your `index.html` to include this `config.js`:\\n ```html\\n <script src=\"\"%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js\"\"></script>\\n ```\\n\\n3. **Access Configurations in React**: In your React components, you can access these configurations through the `window.config` object:\\n ```javascript\\n const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl;\\n ```\\n\\n4. **Deploy Configurations**: When deploying your application, ensure to create a config file mount in the specified path for each environment, so your React app can access it.\\n\\n### 2. Secure Storage for Sensitive Secrets\\nChoreo securely stores all configurations and secrets in an encrypted secret vault in the cloud. If you're utilizing a private data plane, the configurations and secrets are stored in Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.\\n\\n### Important Notes:\\n- Ensure that you do not expose sensitive information in your React application that can be accessed by users.\\n- Regularly manage and rotate your secret keys through the Choreo console.\\n\\nFor detailed instructions on managing configurations and secrets, visit the [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/) documentation. Additionally, for building and deploying web applications, refer to the [Build and Deploy a Single-Page Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/build-and-deploy-a-single-page-web-application/#manage-runtime-configurations-for-web-applications) documentation.\",\n",
    "\"To protect a web application in Choreo, you can follow several recommended steps and best practices. Here’s a structured approach to securing your web application:\\n\\n### 1. Set Up Managed Authentication\\nImplement authentication and authorization for your web application using Choreo's managed authentication.\\n\\n- **Implement Sign-in Functionality**: Create a sign-in button that redirects users to the `/auth/login` path. Use the following code snippet:\\n ```javascript\\n <button onClick={() => {window.location.href=\"\"/auth/login\"\"}}>Login</button>\\n ```\\n- **Obtain User Information Claims**: After sign-in, access user information claims either via a cookie (`userinfo` cookie) or by invoking the `/auth/userinfo` endpoint.\\n- **Implement Sign-out Functionality**: Create a sign-out button that redirects users to the `/auth/logout` path using the `session_hint`:\\n ```javascript\\n <button onClick={async () => {\\n window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`;\\n }}>Logout</button>\\n ```\\n\\n### 2. Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths\\nWhen deploying your web application, ensure that managed authentication is enabled. You can configure the following settings:\\n\\n- **Post Login Path**: Set the path to redirect users after successful sign-in.\\n- **Post Logout Path**: Specify where users are redirected after sign-out.\\n- **Error Path**: Define a custom error page for any authentication errors.\\n- **Session Expiry Time**: Set an appropriate session expiry time to enhance security.\\n\\n### 3. Follow OWASP Security Guidelines\\nAdhere to the OWASP security guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities:\\n\\n- **Use Random IDs**: Avoid predictable identifiers; prefer UUIDs.\\n- **Avoid Basic Authentication**: Use more secure authentication mechanisms instead of basic auth.\\n- **Never Expose API Keys in URLs**: Always pass API keys in headers or cookies, not in the URL.\\n- **Implement Rate Limiting**: Protect your API from abuse by defining rate limits.\\n- **Use HTTPS**: Always serve your application over HTTPS to protect data in transit.\\n\\n### 4. Manage Access Tokens\\nFor JWT access tokens:\\n- **Use Short-lived Tokens**: Set a short expiry time (recommended no more than 15 minutes) to reduce the risk if tokens are compromised.\\n- **Implement Strong Encryption**: Ensure tokens are securely stored and transmitted.\\n\\n### 5. Handle Session Expiry Gracefully\\nImplement logic in your application to handle `401 Unauthorized` responses by prompting users to re-login.\\n\\n### 6. Set Up Custom Error Pages\\nConfigure a custom error page that users are redirected to in case of authentication errors, ensuring better user experience and security.\\n\\nBy following these practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your web application on Choreo.\\n\\nFor detailed steps on setting up managed authentication and enabling it for your web application, you can refer to the documentation here: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-your-web-application) and [OWASP Top 10](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-governance/default-rulesets/owasp_top_10_doc/).\",\n",
    "\"To secure or protect an API in Choreo, you can utilize several methods that focus on authentication and authorization. Here are the primary methods:\\n\\n1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:\\n - RBAC is a flexible and scalable approach to managing access to API resources based on roles assigned to users or groups. Each role determines the permissions granted to perform operations on an API resource. For example, you can define roles such as \"\"HR manager\"\" who can perform all operations, and \"\"HR officer\"\" who can only list users. This method allows you to control user access efficiently.\\n - For more details on implementing RBAC in Choreo, you can refer to the [RBAC tutorial](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/secure-an-api-with-role-based-access-control/).\\n\\n2. **Integration with Identity Providers (IdPs)**:\\n - Choreo supports integration with external IdPs like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Asgardeo. By configuring these IdPs, you can securely authenticate API invocations.\\n - For Azure AD, you can assign scopes to an API and manage authentication through Azure, allowing you to control access based on specific roles or permissions.\\n - For Asgardeo, similar steps can be followed to set up API access and manage authentication with scopes.\\n - Learn more about integrating with Azure AD [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-azure-ad/) and with Asgardeo [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/).\\n\\n3. **Choreo Built-In Security Token Service**:\\n - Choreo offers a built-in security token service that simplifies API security testing. It allows developers to test APIs with permissions in non-critical environments and manage roles and permissions directly within Choreo. \\n - This includes assigning scopes, creating roles, and mapping user groups, which can help ensure that only authorized users can access specific API functions.\\n - Detailed steps to test secure API access using Choreo's built-in service can be found [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/).\\n\\nThese methods collectively enhance the security of APIs in Choreo, ensuring that only authorized users can access and perform actions within your API.\",\n",

    "\"In Choreo, applications can be configured to scale automatically using the \"\"scale-to-zero\"\" feature. This feature is particularly beneficial for managing resources efficiently, as it allows your applications to scale down to zero when they are idle and automatically scale up when requests are received.\\n\\n### Key Features of Scale-to-Zero\\n\\n1. **Default Behavior**: \\n - For service components and web apps created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default.\\n - When an application is idle for about 5 minutes, it will automatically scale down to zero. When a new HTTP request is received, it scales up to handle the request.\\n\\n2. **Manual Configuration for Existing Components**:\\n - For components created before February 23, 2024, you need to enable scale-to-zero manually through the Choreo Console.\\n - Steps:\\n 1. Access the **Component Listing** and select your component.\\n 2. Ensure the component is deployed and ready for traffic.\\n 3. Navigate to **DevOps** → **Scaling** and enable the **scale-to-zero** feature.\\n\\n3. **Scaling Limits**:\\n - You can set a maximum number of replicas for your application, allowing it to scale up dynamically to meet high traffic demands.\\n - If the number of pending requests exceeds a specified threshold (default is 100), Choreo will automatically add a new replica.\\n\\n4. **Idle Time and Proxy Handling**:\\n - When scaled down to zero, an intermediary proxy service holds incoming requests and queues them until the application scales up.\\n - The first request after a period of inactivity may experience a delay as the application scales from zero, and this could lead to timeouts in service chains.\\n\\n5. **Health Checks**:\\n - It’s important to fine-tune the readiness probe settings in the **DevOps** → **Health Checks** view to avoid issues like the first request returning a 503 status code.\\n\\n6. **Use Cases**:\\n - The scale-to-zero feature is especially useful in lower environments to reduce infrastructure costs. In production, consider using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for guaranteed high availability.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nBy configuring the scale-to-zero feature in Choreo, you can ensure that your applications efficiently manage resources while being responsive to incoming traffic.

This feature automatically adjusts the number of replicas of your services based on the incoming HTTP traffic, ensuring that your applications can handle increased demand without unnecessary resource consumption.\\n\\n### Here’s how the scale-to-zero feature works:\\n\\n1. **Automatic Scaling**: When enabled, your services will scale down to zero when there are no incoming HTTP requests. Upon receiving a request, Choreo will create a replica to handle the request, scaling up from zero to one replica. If there are additional requests, it will continue to scale up to the maximum number of replicas you have configured.\\n\\n2. **Thresholds for Scaling**: You can set a threshold for the number of pending requests that will trigger the spawning of additional replicas. If the number of pending requests exceeds this threshold, Choreo will automatically add new replicas to manage the load.\\n\\n3. **Idle State**: If the service remains idle for approximately 5 minutes, it will scale back down to zero until a new request arrives.\\n\\n### Steps to Enable Scale-to-Zero:\\n\\nFor services created after February 23, 2024, the scale-to-zero feature is enabled by default. If you are using services created before this date, you can enable it by following these steps:\\n\\n1. In the Choreo Console, go to the **Component Listing** and select the component you want to scale.\\n2. Ensure the component is deployed and ready to receive traffic.\\n3. Navigate to the **DevOps** section and click on **Scaling**.\\n4.

In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console.

Ensure you are in the correct organization where you have a project with the API to configure a traffic alert. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click Usage Insights. In the left navigation menu on the Usage Insights page, click Alerts. Click the Environment list and select the required environment. Click Alert Configuration. This opens the Alert Configuration pane. Click the Traffic tab. In the API Name field, select the API for which you want to configure the alert. Only the APIs that you have invoked at least once are listed here. For other APIs, you need to give the API name in the required format as instructed in the UI. In the Metric field, select the required metric against which you want to evaluate the alert configuration. In the Threshold field, specify the threshold number of requests per minute. If required, specify the list of emails that should be notified when the alert is generated in the Emails field. Click Add. Once an alert is successfully added, the alert configuration is listed in the Alert Configuration pane. Each configuration can be edited and removed via this pane. Setting Up Latency Alerts Latency alerts notify you if the response latency of an API exceeds a predefined threshold. This is useful for APIs that need to meet specific SLAs and for proactively identifying slow APIs. Ensure you are in the correct organization where you have a project with the API to configure a latency alert. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click Usage Insights. In the left navigation menu on the Usage Insights page, click Alerts. Click the Environment list and select the required environment. Click Alert Configuration.

This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity.

         "Yes, you can set usage limits for your API in Choreo based on different tiers. This is typically done through the API management features available in Choreo. Here’s how you can implement usage limits based on tiers:\n\n1. **Define API Tiers**: Create different tiers for your API, such as Free, Basic, and Premium. Each tier can have its own set of usage limits.\n\n2. **Set Quotas**: For each tier, define the quotas that specify the maximum number of requests allowed within a certain time frame (e.g., per minute, hour, or day).\n\n3. **Apply Policies**: Use policies to enforce these quotas. You can configure rate limiting and throttling policies that apply to each tier.\n\n4. **Assign Tiers to Users**: When users subscribe to your API, assign them to the appropriate tier based on their subscription plan.\n\n5. **Monitor Usage**: Utilize Choreo's observability features to monitor API usage and ensure that the limits are being enforced correctly.\n\nFor detailed steps on how to set up API tiers and usage limits, please refer to the official Choreo documentation on [API Management](https://choreo.dev/docs/api-management).",
         "Yes, you can set usage limits for your API based on different tiers using API subscription plans in Choreo. Here's how you can do it: Creating API Subscription Plans: API subscription plans allow you to define rules and limitations on how clients can interact with your APIs. These plans can include rate limits and burst controls to manage traffic and prevent misuse. Follow these steps to create a subscription plan: Navigate to Subscription Plans: In the Choreo Console header, go to the Organization list and select your organization. In the left navigation menu, click Settings. Click the API Management tab and then click Subscription Plans. Create a New Subscription Plan: Click + Add Subscription Plan.

Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage.\n\n4. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:\n   - Configure CORS settings to control which domains are allowed to access your API. This adds an additional layer of security by preventing unauthorized domains from making requests.\n\n5. **IP Whitelisting**:\n   - Restrict access to your API by allowing only specific IP addresses or ranges. This is useful for internal APIs or APIs that should only be accessed from known locations.\n\n6. **HTTPS**:\n   - Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. This protects sensitive information from being intercepted during transmission.\n\n7. **Input Validation**:\n   - Implement input validation to ensure that the data received by your API is in the expected format and does not contain malicious content.\n\n8. **Logging and Monitoring**:\n   - Enable logging and monitoring to track access and usage patterns. This helps in identifying potential security threats and responding to incidents.\n\nFor detailed guidance on implementing these security measures, please refer to the official Choreo documentation on [API Security](https://choreo.dev/docs/api-security).",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "My service gets overloaded with requests how to fix this?",
         "To address service overload issues in Choreo, you can consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Scaling Up**:\n   - Increase the resources allocated to your service. This can be done by adjusting the service's configuration in Choreo to allocate more CPU and memory.\n\n2. **Load Balancing**:\n   - Implement load balancing to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of your service. This can help manage traffic more effectively.\n\n3. **Rate Limiting**:\n   - Use rate limiting to control the number of requests a user can make to your service within a specific time frame. This can prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.\n\n4. **Caching**:\n   - Implement caching strategies to store frequently accessed data temporarily. This reduces the load on your service by serving cached responses instead of processing the same requests repeatedly.\n\n5. **Asynchronous Processing**:\n   - If applicable, consider using asynchronous processing for long-running tasks. This allows your service to respond quickly to requests while processing them in the background.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Observability**:\n   - Utilize Choreo's observability features to monitor your service's performance. Set up alerts for high traffic or resource usage to proactively manage overload situations.\n\n7. **Optimize Code**:\n   - Review and optimize your service code to ensure it is efficient and can handle requests more effectively.\n\n8. **Use of Webhooks**:\n   - If applicable, consider using webhooks to offload some processing to external systems, reducing the load on your service.\n\nFor detailed guidance on scaling and optimizing your services, refer to the official Choreo documentation on [Scaling Services](https://choreo.dev/docs/deploying-and-managing-services/scaling-services) and [Observability](https://choreo.dev/docs/monitoring-and-observability/overview).",
         "Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon. Expand the Rate Limiting section under Manage. Select a Rate Limiting Level and click Apply. Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count. For API Proxy components, the process differs slightly. After step 2, click the settings icon next to API Configuration and proceed directly to selecting the Rate Limiting Level.",

         "To resolve module-related errors when deploying a Python project in Choreo, especially if you encounter a \"Module not found\" error, consider the following strategies:\n\n### 1. Correct the Module Path\nWhen importing modules that are located in non-standard directories (such as inside virtual environments), ensure that you specify the full path to the required module. This prevents the \"Module not found\" error. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom /absolute/path/to/module import MyClass\n```\n\n### 2. Update Your Project Configuration\nIf your module or dependencies are located elsewhere in the file system, be sure to update the `component.yaml` configuration file accordingly. Ensure that all paths are correctly specified.\n\n### 3. Use an External Virtual Environment\nDeploying projects with an external virtual environment allows for better isolation and easier management of dependencies. This can mitigate issues related to file structure.\n\n### 4. Handle File Warnings During Deployment\nChoreo will issue warnings if your source code violates best practices while it is being deployed. Pay attention to any errors related to file paths, imports, or configuration, which could indicate issues with how modules are structured or accessed.\n\n### Example Configuration\nEnsure your `component.yaml` is set up properly:\n```yaml\nimage: \"your-image\"\nbuildPackConfig: {}\nenvMounts:\n- name: PYTHON_PATHS\n  value: [/path/to/venv, /path/to/lib]\nbuildpacks: {}\ncpus: 1\ncardinality: SINGULAR\nportBindingMode: EXTERNAL\nbuildLogUrl: <BUILD-BASED-WORKFLOW-TOKEN>\n```\nThis setup helps choreograph how Choreo interacts with your application and ensures all components function correctly.\n\n### 5. Debugging and Log Monitoring\nIn case of persistent module errors, enabling logging and debugging can provide insights into where things go wrong. Monitor logs to identify any misconfigurations that may lead to the \"Module not found\" error.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage and mitigate module-related errors effectively during the deployment of your Python project in Choreo. \n\nFor more detailed information, refer to the following links:\n- [Develop Components With Git](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-components-with-git/#create-a-new-component)\n- [Develop Applications With Docker](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-applications-with-docker/#create-a-new-containerized-component)\n- [Manage Component Buildpack Configurations](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-component-buildpack-configurations/)",
         "To resolve a **Module not found** error during the deployment of a Python project in Choreo:\n\n1. **Verify Dependencies:**\n - Ensure all required Python modules are in `requirements.txt`\n - Example `requirements.txt`:\n ```plaintext\n flask\n requests\n numpy\n ```\n\n2. **Check File Paths:**\n - Verify that the modules and packages being imported in your Python code have the correct file paths\n\n3. **Rebuild the Component:**\n - Trigger a rebuild after updating `requirements.txt` or file paths. This will ensure that any changes made to the dependencies are included in the new build.\n\n4. **Inspect Logs:**\n - . If the error persists check build logs in Choreo Console UI for detailed error messages. The logs can provide more context on which module is not found and why. \n\n5. **Environment Configuration:**\n - Ensure correct setup of environment variables in Choreo.

After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

         "How to configure Azure as an external IdP?",
         "To configure Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) as an external Identity Provider (IdP) in Choreo, you need to follow these steps:\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Ensure you have administrator privileges on your Choreo organization.\n- You should also be aware that the API handler for external IdPs does not enforce mutual TLS (mTLS), meaning that only the client certificate is verified. This implies that if you use a private certificate store for authentication, the server's certificate will not automatically verify.\n\n### Steps to Configure Azure AD as an External IdP\n1. **Access Settings**: Go to the top menu of the Choreo Console and click on **Settings**. This will take you to the settings page of your organization.\n   \n2. **Navigate to Organization Settings**: In the left navigation menu, select **Organization** to access your organization-level settings.\n\n3. **Identity Providers Tab**: Click on the **Identity Providers** tab and then click on **+ Identity Provider** to add a new identity provider.\n\n4. **Select Azure AD**: Choose **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** from the list of available identity providers.\n\n5. **Obtain Well-Known URL**:\n   - To retrieve the `Well-Known URL` of your Azure AD instance, sign in to your Azure account and go to your user box in the Azure portal.\n   - Under **Account** settings, select **Application Settings** to see the **Well-Known URL**, which will look like this: `[ENVIRONMENT-NAME].login.microsoftonline.com/issuer/` (e.g., https://login.microsoftonline.com/v2.0/).\n   - Alternatively, you can copy the `OpenID Connect metadata endpoint` from the Azure AD instance settings directly.\n\n6. **Add Custom Domain (Optional)**:\n   - If you want to customize the login experience, you can follow these steps after obtaining the `Well-Known URL` to set up a custom domain.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- When configuring the IdP, you may encounter a verification process, where you must enter the well-known URL of your Azure AD instance. If there are discrepancies between the expected values and what you input during this verification, consider reviewing the relevant settings in your Azure AD instance.\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully integrate Azure AD as an external IdP within Choreo. For more detailed guidance, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-an-external-idp/configure-azure-ad-as-an-external-idp/) or for broader security and access management practices [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/self-sign-up-and-self-sign-in/#configure-self-sign-up-and-self-sign-in).",

To obtain the `Well-Known URL` of your Azure AD instance, on your Azure account, under **Azure Active Directory** go to **App registrations**, and then **Endpoints**. Copy the URI under`OpenID Connect metadata document`.\n8. Leave the **Apply to all environments** checkbox selected. However, if you want to restrict the use of the external IdP to a certain environment, you can select them from the **Environments** list.\n9. Review the endpoints and click **Next**.\n\nPlease note that in Azure, there are two versions of access tokens available. By default, the IDP applications you create use the v1 access token. Therefore, if you intend to use the v1 access token, when providing the `Well-Known URL`, omit the v2.0 path segment from the URL. If you intend to work with v2.0, then the IDP application's manifest should be changed as explained in the access token documentation.\n\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to the [official documentation]",

         "To secure your web application using Choreo, you can follow several best practices that include implementing security measures at various levels to protect both the frontend and backend components of your application.\n\n### Key Security Practices in Choreo\n\n1. **User Authentication and Authorization**: \n   - **Enable OAuth Security Token Service**: Set up an identity provider such as Asgardeo or Microsoft Azure Active Directory to manage user authentication.\n   - **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign users to groups based on their roles to manage access permissions effectively.\n   - **Secure API Endpoints**: Ensure that API endpoints are secured with appropriate authorization keys (like JWT) and implement role-based access.\n\n2. **Environment Configuration**:\n   - When deploying your application, set the configuration as secure content. You should encrypt sensitive values like API keys and secrets, either using environment variables or secret stores.\n\n3. **Secure Data Storage**:\n   - Use a key vault to store encrypted secrets for critical services. This helps in managing credentials securely.\n   - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in code, as it can lead to unauthorized exposure during deployments.\n\n4. **Threat Detection and Mitigation**:\n   - Implement effective monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to security threats. This includes setting up alerts for unusual activity or suspicious behavior.\n\n5. **Regular Updates and Patch Management**:\n   - Keep your software updated with the latest versions of libraries, frameworks, and platforms to mitigate vulnerabilities.\n\n6. **Testing and Validation**:\n   - Perform thorough security testing throughout your development lifecycle, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing to ensure robustness against various attacks.\n\n### Tools and Features Provided by Choreo\n\n- **Built-in Identity Provider (IdP)**: \n  - You can create applications and user stores within Choreo to facilitate user management, ensuring secure login and access control.\n  \n- **Secure Connection Settings**:\n  - Choreo automatically generates secure connection URLs to connect your frontend and backend applications. These URLs will only be accessible from approved IP ranges, adding an extra layer of protection.\n\nFor more detailed guidance on configuring security for your web application in Choreo, refer to the documentation here: [Secure Web Applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications/).\n\nIf you have any specific questions regarding these security measures, feel free to ask!",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

         "What are the steps to secure an API in Choreo?",
         "To secure APIs using Choreo, you can follow these main approaches: utilizing role-based access control and implementing API key-based security. Here’s a detailed overview of both methods:\n\n### 1. Using Role-Based Access Control\n- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each user in your organization is assigned one or more roles, and each role has specific permissions defined. This ensures that only users with appropriate roles have access to API endpoints.\n- **Assign Roles**: \n  - You need to assign appropriate roles to users. The default roles in Choreo include:\n    - API Publisher: Can create, publish, and manage APIs.\n    - API Subscriber: Can consume APIs after subscribing.\n  - Choreo provides out-of-the-box permissions for managing APIs, such as `LIST_API`, `CREATE_API`, etc., which help in assigning roles effectively.\n- **Manage Users and Roles**: Ensure that the users associated with the roles have their login credentials and that their respective roles and permissions are properly configured.\n\n![Configure roles and users](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/api-management/security/configure-roles-and-users.png)\n\n![Manage subscriptions](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/api-management/security/manage-subscriptions.png)\n\n### 2. Implementing API Key-Based Security\n- **API Keys**: \n  - Each API in Choreo is configured with unique keys called API keys. These keys are essential for identifying and authorizing requests to the API.\n  - API consumers can generate application keys programmatically and securely embed them into their clients to authenticate requests. Choreo also offers the option to generate API keys via the Developer Portal UI for testing purposes.\n- **Secure Application Keys**:\n  - Choreo allows generating API keys in various languages, such as Go, Node.js, Java, PHP, Python, C#, or C++. It's important to ensure proper security measures when storing or transmitting these keys.\n- **API Key Lifecycle**:\n  - API keys are valid until they reach their expiration date or are revoked manually through the Developer Portal UI. This helps maintain a robust security posture by limiting unauthorized access.\n\nFor detailed guidance on securing APIs with Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Secure API Consumption](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/secure-api-consumption/)\n- [Secure APIs with Basic Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-apis-with-basic-authentication/) \n\nThese steps will help you implement effective security measures for your APIs within Choreo.",

         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Steps to Set Up Auto Scaling\n\n1. **Create an Application**:\n   - Start by creating a new application in Choreo if you haven't done so already.\n\n2. **Access DevOps**:\n   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the left menu and click on **DevOps**, then select **Scaling**.\n\n3. **Configure Min & Max Replicas**:\n   - In the **Scaling** pane, configure the minimum (`minReplicas`) and maximum (`maxReplicas`) number of replicas for your application.\n   \n4. **Set Scale-to-Zero Option**:\n   - Ensure that the checkbox marked \"scale-to-zero\" is selected. This setting is important for reducing costs and minimizing resource utilization when your application's traffic is low.\n\n5. **Enable Autoscaler**:\n   - Click on **Create** to enable the auto-scaling functionality.\n\nAfter setting up, your application will automatically scale based on CPU thresholds defined for the environment at the time of deployment. When the allocated CPU limit is reached, Choreo will automatically increase the number of replicas, allowing requests to be managed efficiently.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Choreo supports auto-scaling for deployments with readiness and liveness probes. If your application does not have these probes, automatic scaling cannot be configured.\n- Be aware that the CPU threshold represents the percentage of time that must be within the defined limit for scaling to trigger; for example, setting the threshold at 70% means that if the request rate exceeds this limit for 70% of the time, it will trigger scaling.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, refer to the [Choreo documentation on auto-scaling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-autoscaler/#set-up-auto-scaling).",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "How can I monitor the performance of my services deployed on Choreo?",
         "To monitor the performance of services deployed on Choreo, you can utilize a combination of built-in diagnostics and observability features. Here’s how you can effectively manage and assess the performance of your deployed services:\n\n### 1. Utilize Metrics and Observability Views\nChoreo offers a comprehensive set of metrics and observability views to monitor various aspects of your deployed services. You can access these through the observability page in the Choreo console:\n- **Diagnostics Page**: This displays logs related to errors and warnings within a specified timeframe.\n- **Metrics Pane**: This provides insights into critical metrics for troubleshooting service issues, such as:\n  - Latencies\n  - Error counts\n  - Status codes\n  - Resource utilization\n\n### 2. Enable Diagnostics Logging\nIf you need more granular diagnostic information, you can enable logging and generate detailed logs at key execution points within your service. This involves configuring log levels and output destinations for fine-tuned diagnostics:\n\n- **Set Log Levels**:\n  - Navigate to **Configs & Logs** under **DevOps** > **Logs**.\n  - Select the component to view running replicas.\n  - Adjust the appropriate level settings based on the type of logs required. For example:\n    - **ERROR, WARNING, INFO**: For general visibility.\n    - **DEBUG**: For deeper insights into specific issues.\n\n- **Log Output Destinations**:\n  - By default, logs go to the [WSO2 Logs Hub](https://wso2.com/logs-hub/). However, you can specify external sinks for enhanced observability, especially if using a managed Kubernetes data plane.\n\n### 3. Analyze Observability Metrics\nUse the observability metrics available on the observability page to identify potential areas for improvement:\n- Focus on:\n  - High latency values indicating slow API processing times.\n  - Increased error counts that suggest a service issue.\n  - Unusual resource consumption patterns which may indicate inefficiencies.\n\n### 4. Implement Observability APIs\nChoreo also provides observability APIs that expose insights about service health in real-time. These APIs provide structured monitoring outputs via HTTP GET methods, enabling automated monitoring systems to analyze these outputs effectively. They offer metrics like response time and error percentages over different timeframes, along with status codes.\n\n### Additional Tools for Analysis\nConsider integrating other tools or observability services to complement Choreo's capabilities. For instance, you could use:\n- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for monitoring observability metrics.\n- [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.org/) for collecting telemetry data to enhance service understanding.\n- [WSO2 Log Management](https://wso2.com/log-management/) to manage logs and observability insights.\n\nBy leveraging these features, you can ensure effective monitoring and management of the performance of your deployed services on Choreo.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the documentation on monitoring and observability:\n- [Monitor Services](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/monitor-services/)",

         "I want to control traffic coming to my API.",
         "To control traffic directed towards your API using Choreo, you can implement two key traffic control mechanisms: rate limiting and throttling.\n\n### Rate Limiting\nRate limiting restricts the number of requests that can be made to an API within a specified time frame. This helps prevent system overload and ensures fair usage for all consumers. You can set different rate limits based on the type of API deployment context:\n\n- **API Deployment Context**: Applies across environments.\n- **Organization**: Enforces the same rate limit across all environments.\n- **Project**: Restricts access to a specific project level, allowing for different limits between projects if needed.\n\n#### Configuration Steps for Rate Limiting:\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, select the component you wish to manage.\n2. Navigate to the **Develop** section and click on **Deploy**.\n3. Go to the **Set Up** card and choose the appropriate environment tab, then enable **Rate Limiting**.\n4. Specify the **Request Limit** and define time units as either seconds or minutes.\n5. Click **Add Request Header** to configure additional headers or select existing ones.\n6. If needed, expand the **Burst Control** section to adjust the maximum response rate.\n7. Finally, select **Apply** to save the settings.\n\n### Throttling\nThrottling allows organizations to manage the request count from all APIs while controlling who accesses those APIs. It applies across multiple environments. You can control who consumes your API based on roles assigned at the organization level.\n\n#### Configuration Steps for Throttling:\n1. In the Choreo Console, go to the top navigation menu and click on **Organization**. Then select your organization.\n2. Under **Settings**, choose the **API Management** tab and then click on the **Traffic Control** tab.\n3. Toggle the **Organization Level** switch and configure any other relevant settings as needed.\n4. Save your changes to apply them.\n\n### Important Notes\n- The ability to throttle requests is only available when your API deployment context is set to \"Organization\" or \"Project\".\n- Be aware that if you set up throttling, API request quotas may exceed the rate limit set in the respective environment, potentially leading to increased latency.\n\nFor detailed steps and configurations, you can refer to the documentation here:\n- [Control Traffic Directed Towards Your API - Rate Limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/traffic-control/control-traffic-directed-towards-your-api/#rate-limiting)\n- [Control Traffic Directed Towards Your API - Throttling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/traffic-control/control-traffic-directed-towards-your-api/#throttling)",

         "I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely?",
         "In Choreo, managing secrets or sensitive configurations is essential to ensure security. When you set secrets or config data as secrets, they are stored in environment-specific secret stores, which enhance confidentiality and protection.\n\n### Managing Secrets Securely in Choreo:\n1. **Use Secrets**: \n   - If your `secret-key` is defined as a secret during the build configuration, it will be encrypted and stored in an environment-specific secret store. You cannot read the secret key value while the container is running. However, you can retrieve the content through a Readiness probe function written in any supported programming language (such as Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, or Node.js).\n\n2. **Secure Access**:\n   - When using secrets, it's imperative to implement secure practices. Although secrets do not have write access restrictions at the component level, it's advised to avoid hardcoding secret values directly into your application code. Instead, rely on the provided mechanisms for securely accessing these secrets.\n\n3. **Configuration Injection**:\n   - If you are using environment variables to inject secrets or configurations into your component, you must ensure that these values are securely managed within your container. While it is possible to connect a volume-mounted file or a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, it is essential to use secure protocols and practices to protect these files from unauthorized access.\n\n4. **Best Practices for Environment Variables**:\n   - When setting environment variables, consider best practices for managing sensitive data:\n     - Avoid using environment variables for secrets. If needed, use secrets for critical information.\n     - Utilize secure vault services to manage credentials and sensitive information.\n\n5. **Security Measures**:\n   - In addition to these general guidelines, make sure to adhere to broader security recommendations specific to Choreo, such as implementing appropriate firewall policies, threat hunting capabilities, incident response plans, and compliance with data privacy regulations.\n\nFor detailed guidance on configuring secrets in your React web application within Choreo, refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#manage-secrets-in-choreo). This will provide step-by-step instructions on how to manage your secret keys securely in the Choreo console.\n\nFor more information about configuring a secret for your component, visit: [Configure a Secret for Your Component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/configure-a-secret-for-your-component/).",
         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it.

         "To enhance security for your web application using Choreo's managed environment, you can implement various strategies that include configuration settings, API security, and user management. Here are some key points and specific steps you can follow:\n\n### 1. Protect Web Applications with Managed Security\nChoreo provides managed security services that integrate with the built-in firewall and ATP (Application Threat Protection) systems. This ensures robust protection for your applications. You need to enable the appropriate policies at each deployment level:\n\n- **High Visibility:**\n  - Turn on the built-in firewall to restrict network traffic.\n  - Use ATP for application-level protection.\n\n- **Low Visibility:**\n  - Use the built-in firewall but turn off ATP for higher privacy.\n\nFor further details on enabling these security measures, refer to [Set Up Application-Level Protection with Choreo ATP](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/application-level-protection/#set-up-application-level-protection-with-choreo-atp).\n\n### 2. Secure Web Application APIs with OAuth 2.0\nUsing secure OAuth 2.0 authorization flows helps manage access to your APIs effectively:\n\n#### Step-by-Step Guide:\n1. **Create a Web Application**: If you don't have one already, create a web application in the Choreo Console.\n   \n2. **Configure the Web Application**:\n   - Select **Settings** in the left menu of the Developer Portal tab.\n   - Click **OAuth 2.0 Configurations** and generate credentials for your application. Save these for later reference.\n\n3. **Authorize Your Web Application API**:\n   - In the Choreo Console, go to **Settings**, then to **Applications**.\n   - Authorize the API with the appropriate scopes by copying the authorization URL and redirect URI from the Web Application Configurations.\n   - Implement a POST request using the provided token endpoint, including parameters like grant type and access token.\n\n4. **Secure API Access**: Use tokens securely and validate them at the API endpoint using OAuth libraries or services like `jwt-go` if necessary.\n\nFor more comprehensive guidance, you can visit [Secure Web Application APIs with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-application-apis-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/).\n\n### 3. Control API Access with Fine-Grained Authentication\nTo enforce fine-grained access control based on roles or groups:\n\n- Ensure that the user role and permission assignments align with your application needs.\n- Set up API policies to allow or deny requests based on these role-based permissions. For example:\n  - Allow users with roles prefixed with \"Developer\" access to all APIs.\n  - Restrict users to specific projects by default and then grant additional permissions for broader access.\n\nThis setup helps maintain a controlled environment while minimizing security risks associated with unrestricted access.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy implementing the above measures, you can significantly enhance the security of your web application hosted on Choreo. These steps cover both application-level protection and API security, ensuring that your services are well-guarded against potential threats.\n\nFor detailed instructions on each step, please refer to the respective links provided.",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

         "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?",
         "In Choreo, there are several methods you can use to protect your APIs, both from unauthorized access and attacks:\n\n1. **API Key Based Security**: \n   - You can implement API key-based security using service components. By defining API keys that consumers must provide for each request, this method prevents unauthorized use.\n   - When creating an API, you can set it up as secure by either including the API key in every request (recommended) or allowing a specific path to be open to unsecured traffic.\n\n2. **Basic Authentication**:\n   - Basic authentication is another way to secure API access. This method requires API consumers to provide username and password credentials as part of each request. It provides a simple approach to manage user authentication and access control.\n\n3. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**:\n   - Implementing JWT is beneficial when securing REST APIs, especially in distributed environments. The JWT is signed digitally with a secret key, ensuring that it remains intact during transmission through a network, and verifying its integrity upon receipt.\n\n4. **Role-Based Access Control**:\n   - This feature allows you to assign different roles and permissions to developers. When a developer registers with Choreo, they can specify their roles, enabling organizations to enforce proper authorization based on these roles. For instance, you might grant different functionalities based on whether an API is intended for public consumption or internal use.\n\n5. **Feature-Level Security**:\n   - Choreo automatically applies organization-level authentication and authorization policies at the API proxy level for all components within your project. This includes:\n     - Protecting your services from attack vectors like Denial of Service (DoS), SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities.\n     - Enhancing privacy protections by anonymizing data transmitted via Choreo’s APIs.\n   - This security posture can be adjusted by managing role-based access controls at both the organization and project levels.\n\nThese measures will help ensure that your API is robust against various threats while maintaining secure access for authorized users.\n\nFor more detailed information on these protection features, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Protect APIs with Choreo Built-in Security Services](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-services/)\n- [Secure REST APIs with OAuth 2.0](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-rest-apis-with-oauth2/)",

         "How do I configure my applications to scale automatically?",
         "To configure your application in Choreo to scale automatically based on specific conditions, you need to create an **Autoscaler** that triggers based on the resource usage metrics of your application. Here’s how you can set it up:\n\n### Prerequisites\n- Ensure you have deployed or promoted your service at least once. This step is necessary as it helps the API Insights feature to generate critical usage metrics.\n- Make sure that the API and its associated integrations are created within the same project and environment, as Autoscaler configuration is available only at the project level.\n\n### Steps to Create an Autoscaler\n1. **Go to Your Component**: Navigate to the component you want to manage scaling for.\n2. **Access Scale-to-Zero Settings**:\n   - In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps**.\n   - Then select **Scaling**.\n3. **Create an Autoscaler**:\n   - Click on **+ Create**.\n   - Choose to connect to **Azure** under **Cloud Provider** (you may use other major cloud providers, but this guide will focus on Azure).\n   - Fill out the details as per the options provided for the scale-to-zero setup.\n4. **Define Conditions for Scaling**:\n   - You can define conditions that trigger the autoscaling logic based on resource consumption, which will determine when to scale up or down.\n5. **Apply Changes**: \n   - After configuring the desired conditions, click **Add** to apply them.\n6. **Finalize Setup**:\n   - Finally, click **Create** to complete the setup and activate the autoscaler immediately.\n\n### Important Notes\n- The autoscaler scales your application down to zero when no requests are being served, effectively reducing idle workloads during off-peak times.\n- Once triggered, it takes some time (about 5-10 minutes) for the minimum replicas to be added.\n\nBy following these steps, your application should now scale automatically based on its usage metrics, allowing efficient management without manual intervention. \n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#configure-scale-to-zero).",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "My service gets overloaded with requests how to fix this?",
         "To handle the issue of your service being overwhelmed with requests in Choreo, you can implement various strategies depending on the nature of your service. Here are some common solutions:\n\n1. **Queue Management**: \n   - Implement message queuing or event queues to manage the request flow efficiently. This prevents multiple processes from competing for resources simultaneously, which could lead to a backlog of incoming messages if they do not have any work to do. This is particularly relevant for services that handle asynchronous tasks.\n   - Ensure that your service's architecture allows for effective management of request load.\n\n2. **Throttling**: \n   - Set rate limits or throttles on the API requests to prevent overload. In Choreo, you can configure throttling for your REST APIs to control the number of requests a client can make over a specified time frame. This helps in managing traffic during peak usage times and ensures that your service remains responsive.\n\n3. **Background Tasks**:\n   - For services like message queues and background jobs, set minimum idle times between task executions to avoid rapid consumption of server resources when no work is available.\n\n4. **Load Balancing**: \n   - If you're running your backend application outside the Kubernetes data plane, consider implementing a reliable HTTP service load balancer. Load balancing helps distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of your service, preventing any single point from being overwhelmed.\n\n5. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: \n   - Use HPA to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU resource usage within a specified container. When the request load is high, HPA can scale up the instance count, thereby distributing the load better.\n\n6. **Observability and Monitoring**: \n   - Regularly monitor your service’s performance using Observability features in Choreo. You should be able to observe any abnormalities and analyze logs and metrics to identify potential issues, such as excessive queue lengths or CPU thresholds.\n\n7. **Optimizing Backend Performance**: \n   - Implement caching and optimize your backend to minimize response times and ensure that queries can be handled efficiently. This can include caching responses at the edge, reducing latency by moving closer to user locations (proxies), or using optimized databases for faster retrieval of information.\n\nThese measures collectively help in mitigating the effects of sudden spikes in requests and enhancing overall system resilience and efficiency.\n\nFor further details and steps on configuring throttling, managing service health, and optimizing deployments, you can refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Set Up Rate Limiting for Your API](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-throttling/#set-up-rate-limiting-for-your-api)\n- [Create a Service Health Check](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/create-service-health-checks/)\n- [Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-hpa/)\n- [Troubleshoot Connection Rate Limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-policies/set-up-rate-limiting/#troubleshoot)\n- [Monitor Observability Metrics](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/monitoring-overview/#observability-metrics)",
         "Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon. Expand the Rate Limiting section under Manage. Select a Rate Limiting Level and click Apply. Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count. For API Proxy components, the process differs slightly. After step 2, click the settings icon next to API Configuration and proceed directly to selecting the Rate Limiting Level.",

    "\"To secure APIs using Choreo, you can follow these main approaches: utilizing role-based access control and implementing API key-based security. Here’s a detailed overview of both methods:\\n\\n### 1. Using Role-Based Access Control\\n- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each user in your organization is assigned one or more roles, and each role has specific permissions defined. This ensures that only users with appropriate roles have access to API endpoints.\\n- **Assign Roles**: \\n  - You need to assign appropriate roles to users. The default roles in Choreo include:\\n    - API Publisher: Can create, publish, and manage APIs.\\n    - API Subscriber: Can consume APIs after subscribing.\\n  - Choreo provides out-of-the-box permissions for managing APIs, such as `LIST_API`, `CREATE_API`, etc., which help in assigning roles effectively.\\n- **Manage Users and Roles**: Ensure that the users associated with the roles have their login credentials and that their respective roles and permissions are properly configured.\\n\\n![Configure roles and users](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/api-management/security/configure-roles-and-users.png)\\n\\n![Manage subscriptions](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/api-management/security/manage-subscriptions.png)\\n\\n### 2. Implementing API Key-Based Security\\n- **API Keys**: \\n  - Each API in Choreo is configured with unique keys called API keys. These keys are essential for identifying and authorizing requests to the API.\\n  - API consumers can generate application keys programmatically and securely embed them into their clients to authenticate requests. Choreo also offers the option to generate API keys via the Developer Portal UI for testing purposes.\\n- **Secure Application Keys**:\\n  - Choreo allows generating API keys in various languages, such as Go, Node.js, Java, PHP, Python, C#, or C++. It's important to ensure proper security measures when storing or transmitting these keys.\\n- **API Key Lifecycle**:\\n  - API keys are valid until they reach their expiration date or are revoked manually through the Developer Portal UI. This helps maintain a robust security posture by limiting unauthorized access.\\n\\nFor detailed guidance on securing APIs with Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation links:\\n- [Secure API Consumption](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/secure-api-consumption/)\\n- [Secure APIs with Basic Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-apis-with-basic-authentication/) \\n\\nThese steps will help you implement effective security measures for your APIs within Choreo.\",\n",

    "\"In Choreo, managing secrets or sensitive configurations is essential to ensure security. When you set secrets or config data as secrets, they are stored in environment-specific secret stores, which enhance confidentiality and protection.\\n\\n### Managing Secrets Securely in Choreo:\\n1. **Use Secrets**: \\n   - If your `secret-key` is defined as a secret during the build configuration, it will be encrypted and stored in an environment-specific secret store. You cannot read the secret key value while the container is running. However, you can retrieve the content through a Readiness probe function written in any supported programming language (such as Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, or Node.js).\\n\\n2. **Secure Access**:\\n   - When using secrets, it's imperative to implement secure practices. Although secrets do not have write access restrictions at the component level, it's advised to avoid hardcoding secret values directly into your application code. Instead, rely on the provided mechanisms for securely accessing these secrets.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Injection**:\\n   - If you are using environment variables to inject secrets or configurations into your component, you must ensure that these values are securely managed within your container. While it is possible to connect a volume-mounted file or a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, it is essential to use secure protocols and practices to protect these files from unauthorized access.\\n\\n4. **Best Practices for Environment Variables**:\\n   - When setting environment variables, consider best practices for managing sensitive data:\\n     - Avoid using environment variables for secrets. If needed, use secrets for critical information.\\n     - Utilize secure vault services to manage credentials and sensitive information.\\n\\n5. **Security Measures**:\\n   - In addition to these general guidelines, make sure to adhere to broader security recommendations specific to Choreo, such as implementing appropriate firewall policies, threat hunting capabilities, incident response plans, and compliance with data privacy regulations.\\n\\nFor detailed guidance on configuring secrets in your React web application within Choreo, refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#manage-secrets-in-choreo). This will provide step-by-step instructions on how to manage your secret keys securely in the Choreo console.\\n\\nFor more information about configuring a secret for your component, visit: [Configure a Secret for Your Component](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/configure-a-secret-for-your-component/).\",\n",
    "\"To enhance security for your web application using Choreo's managed environment, you can implement various strategies that include configuration settings, API security, and user management. Here are some key points and specific steps you can follow:\\n\\n### 1. Protect Web Applications with Managed Security\\nChoreo provides managed security services that integrate with the built-in firewall and ATP (Application Threat Protection) systems. This ensures robust protection for your applications. You need to enable the appropriate policies at each deployment level:\\n\\n- **High Visibility:**\\n  - Turn on the built-in firewall to restrict network traffic.\\n  - Use ATP for application-level protection.\\n\\n- **Low Visibility:**\\n  - Use the built-in firewall but turn off ATP for higher privacy.\\n\\nFor further details on enabling these security measures, refer to [Set Up Application-Level Protection with Choreo ATP](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/application-level-protection/#set-up-application-level-protection-with-choreo-atp).\\n\\n### 2. Secure Web Application APIs with OAuth 2.0\\nUsing secure OAuth 2.0 authorization flows helps manage access to your APIs effectively:\\n\\n#### Step-by-Step Guide:\\n1. **Create a Web Application**: If you don't have one already, create a web application in the Choreo Console.\\n   \\n2. **Configure the Web Application**:\\n   - Select **Settings** in the left menu of the Developer Portal tab.\\n   - Click **OAuth 2.0 Configurations** and generate credentials for your application. Save these for later reference.\\n\\n3. **Authorize Your Web Application API**:\\n   - In the Choreo Console, go to **Settings**, then to **Applications**.\\n   - Authorize the API with the appropriate scopes by copying the authorization URL and redirect URI from the Web Application Configurations.\\n   - Implement a POST request using the provided token endpoint, including parameters like grant type and access token.\\n\\n4. **Secure API Access**: Use tokens securely and validate them at the API endpoint using OAuth libraries or services like `jwt-go` if necessary.\\n\\nFor more comprehensive guidance, you can visit [Secure Web Application APIs with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-application-apis-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/).\\n\\n### 3. Control API Access with Fine-Grained Authentication\\nTo enforce fine-grained access control based on roles or groups:\\n\\n- Ensure that the user role and permission assignments align with your application needs.\\n- Set up API policies to allow or deny requests based on these role-based permissions. For example:\\n  - Allow users with roles prefixed with \\\"Developer\\\" access to all APIs.\\n  - Restrict users to specific projects by default and then grant additional permissions for broader access.\\n\\nThis setup helps maintain a controlled environment while minimizing security risks associated with unrestricted access.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nBy implementing the above measures, you can significantly enhance the security of your web application hosted on Choreo. These steps cover both application-level protection and API security, ensuring that your services are well-guarded against potential threats.\\n\\nFor detailed instructions on each step, please refer to the respective links provided.\",\n",
    "\"In Choreo, there are several methods you can use to protect your APIs, both from unauthorized access and attacks:\\n\\n1. **API Key Based Security**: \\n   - You can implement API key-based security using service components. By defining API keys that consumers must provide for each request, this method prevents unauthorized use.\\n   - When creating an API, you can set it up as secure by either including the API key in every request (recommended) or allowing a specific path to be open to unsecured traffic.\\n\\n2. **Basic Authentication**:\\n   - Basic authentication is another way to secure API access. This method requires API consumers to provide username and password credentials as part of each request. It provides a simple approach to manage user authentication and access control.\\n\\n3. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**:\\n   - Implementing JWT is beneficial when securing REST APIs, especially in distributed environments. The JWT is signed digitally with a secret key, ensuring that it remains intact during transmission through a network, and verifying its integrity upon receipt.\\n\\n4. **Role-Based Access Control**:\\n   - This feature allows you to assign different roles and permissions to developers. When a developer registers with Choreo, they can specify their roles, enabling organizations to enforce proper authorization based on these roles. For instance, you might grant different functionalities based on whether an API is intended for public consumption or internal use.\\n\\n5. **Feature-Level Security**:\\n   - Choreo automatically applies organization-level authentication and authorization policies at the API proxy level for all components within your project. This includes:\\n     - Protecting your services from attack vectors like Denial of Service (DoS), SQL injection, and other vulnerabilities.\\n     - Enhancing privacy protections by anonymizing data transmitted via Choreo’s APIs.\\n   - This security posture can be adjusted by managing role-based access controls at both the organization and project levels.\\n\\nThese measures will help ensure that your API is robust against various threats while maintaining secure access for authorized users.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on these protection features, you can refer to the following documentation links:\\n- [Protect APIs with Choreo Built-in Security Services](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-services/)\\n- [Secure REST APIs with OAuth 2.0](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-rest-apis-with-oauth2/)\",\n",

This step is necessary as it helps the API Insights feature to generate critical usage metrics.\\n- Make sure that the API and its associated integrations are created within the same project and environment, as Autoscaler configuration is available only at the project level.\\n\\n### Steps to Create an Autoscaler\\n1. **Go to Your Component**: Navigate to the component you want to manage scaling for.\\n2. **Access Scale-to-Zero Settings**:\\n   - In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps**.\\n   - Then select **Scaling**.\\n3. **Create an Autoscaler**:\\n   - Click on **+ Create**.\\n   - Choose to connect to **Azure** under **Cloud Provider** (you may use other major cloud providers, but this guide will focus on Azure).\\n   - Fill out the details as per the options provided for the scale-to-zero setup.\\n4. **Define Conditions for Scaling**:\\n   - You can define conditions that trigger the autoscaling logic based on resource consumption, which will determine when to scale up or down.\\n5. **Apply Changes**: \\n   - After configuring the desired conditions, click **Add** to apply them.\\n6. **Finalize Setup**:\\n   - Finally, click **Create** to complete the setup and activate the autoscaler immediately.\\n\\n### Important Notes\\n- The autoscaler scales your application down to zero when no requests are being served, effectively reducing idle workloads during off-peak times.\\n- Once triggered, it takes some time (about 5-10 minutes) for the minimum replicas to be added.\\n\\nBy following these steps, your application should now scale automatically based on its usage metrics, allowing efficient management without manual intervention. \\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scale-to-zero/#configure-scale-to-zero).\",\n",
    "\"To handle the issue of your service being overwhelmed with requests in Choreo, you can implement various strategies depending on the nature of your service. Here are some common solutions:\\n\\n1. **Queue Management**: \\n   - Implement message queuing or event queues to manage the request flow efficiently. This prevents multiple processes from competing for resources simultaneously, which could lead to a backlog of incoming messages if they do not have any work to do. This is particularly relevant for services that handle asynchronous tasks.\\n   - Ensure that your service's architecture allows for effective management of request load.\\n\\n2. **Throttling**: \\n   - Set rate limits or throttles on the API requests to prevent overload. In Choreo, you can configure throttling for your REST APIs to control the number of requests a client can make over a specified time frame. This helps in managing traffic during peak usage times and ensures that your service remains responsive.\\n\\n3. **Background Tasks**:\\n   - For services like message queues and background jobs, set minimum idle times between task executions to avoid rapid consumption of server resources when no work is available.\\n\\n4. **Load Balancing**: \\n   - If you're running your backend application outside the Kubernetes data plane, consider implementing a reliable HTTP service load balancer. Load balancing helps distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of your service, preventing any single point from being overwhelmed.\\n\\n5. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: \\n   - Use HPA to automatically adjust the number of replicas based on CPU resource usage within a specified container. When the request load is high, HPA can scale up the instance count, thereby distributing the load better.\\n\\n6. **Observability and Monitoring**: \\n   - Regularly monitor your service’s performance using Observability features in Choreo. You should be able to observe any abnormalities and analyze logs and metrics to identify potential issues, such as excessive queue lengths or CPU thresholds.\\n\\n7. **Optimizing Backend Performance**: \\n   - Implement caching and optimize your backend to minimize response times and ensure that queries can be handled efficiently. This can include caching responses at the edge, reducing latency by moving closer to user locations (proxies), or using optimized databases for faster retrieval of information.\\n\\nThese measures collectively help in mitigating the effects of sudden spikes in requests and enhancing overall system resilience and efficiency.\\n\\nFor further details and steps on configuring throttling, managing service health, and optimizing deployments, you can refer to the following documentation links:\\n- [Set Up Rate Limiting for Your API](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-throttling/#set-up-rate-limiting-for-your-api)\\n- [Create a Service Health Check](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/create-service-health-checks/)\\n- [Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-hpa/)\\n- [Troubleshoot Connection Rate Limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-policies/set-up-rate-limiting/#troubleshoot)\\n- [Monitor Observability Metrics](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/monitoring-overview/#observability-metrics)\",\n",

Implement Authentication for REST APIs\nYou can use an external security token service like Choreo Auth for REST API authentication or integrate any OIDC/OAuth 2.0 compatible Identity Provider (IdP).\n\n#### Steps to Configure:\n1. **Enable Security**: Navigate to your component's **Deployment** page and click on the **Configure & Deploy** option.\n2. **Add Security Context**: On the **Set Up** card, choose the type of context required for your service (OAuth2 Application or OIDC/OAuth2). \n3. **Identity Provider**: Select Choreo Auth as your identity provider and fill in the relevant details such as `Access Token Key` and `Access Token Issuer`.\n4. **Additional Configurations**: Set other required parameters and finalize the configuration.\n\nLearn more about implementing Choreo Auth: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-choreo-auth-for-your-rest-api).\n\n### 2. Manage OAuth Scopes\n- Define scopes that control access based on specific resource permissions, allowing you to fine-tune permissions for different service endpoints.\n- This is crucial for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) effectively.\n\nLearn more about managing OAuth scopes: [Define Secure APIs with Roles and Scopes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/manage-roles-and-scopes-for-api-access/#generate-an-access-token-to-test-the-authorization).\n\n### 3. Generate Credentials and Invocations\nAfter securing your API with OAuth, generate credentials for testing purposes and invoke your secured service:\n- Under the **Manage** tab of your component, click **Endpoints** to get the invoke URL.\n- To invoke the service, use a POST request with appropriate header keys, values, payload, and OAuth2 tokens if applicable.\n\nMore details on generating keys and invoking services: [Develop a Web Application with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-a-web-application-with-managed-authentication/#step-4-generate-keys-and-invoke-the-service).\n\n### 4. Enable Real-Sample Scenarios (for PDP)\nIf you are using the Private Data Plane (PDP), you need to enable real-sample scenarios to test authentication:\n1. Click **Authentication Settings** under the **Manage** tab of your component.\n2. Turn on the toggle for real-sample scenarios.\n3. Redeploy the application from the left navigation menu after enabling it.\n\nFurther information: [Test the Real-Sample Scenario for Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-real-sample-scenario-for-managed-authentication/#enable-real-sample-scenario-to-test-managed-authentication).\n\n### Additional Resources\nFor further insights, check the following documentation links:\n- [Consume an External OAuth2 Secured Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/consume-an-external-oauth2-seeded-service/#securely-consume-the-service-through-choreo)\n- [Secure REST APIs with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-restapis-with-built-in-security-token-service/#generate-an-access-token-for-testing)\n- [Secure Communication between Microservices](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-communication-between-microservices/#generate-an-access-token-for-testing)\n- [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#set-up-choreo-auth-for-your-rest-api)\n- [Consume an OpenID Connect Secured Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/consuming-an-external-idp-backed-rest-service/#consume-an-opentid-connect-seeded-service)\n- [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control/) \n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to implement and manage authentication for your services effectively within Choreo.",
         "To add **authentication** to a service in **Choreo**, you can utilize **Choreo's managed authentication** or configure **custom authentication**. Here are the steps for integrating managed authentication and custom authentication:\n\n**Managed Authentication**\nManaged authentication is a feature provided by **Choreo** that simplifies the process of adding authentication and authorization to your web application. It supports web applications created with **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js** buildpacks.\n\n**Steps to Implement Managed Authentication:**\n\n1. **Implement Sign-in Functionality:**\n```<button onClick={() => { window.location.href = /auth/login }}>Login</button>```\nThis redirects users to the **login path** where **Choreo** handles the authentication process.\n\n2. **Obtain User Information Claims:**\n\n**Via Cookie:**\n```import Cookies from 'js-cookie';\nconst encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo');\nconst userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo));\nCookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' });```\n\n**Via GET Endpoint:**\n```const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo');```\n\n3. **Implement Sign-out Functionality:**\n```<button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`;}}>Logout</button>```\n\n4. **Invoke APIs:**\n```const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>');```\n\n**Custom Authentication**\nIf you prefer to handle authentication manually or use custom authentication mechanisms, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Steps to Implement Custom Authentication:**\n\n1. **Add the Connection Configuration:**\n```window.configs = {\napiUrl: '<SERVICE_URL>',\nconsumerKey: '<CONSUMER_KEY>',\nconsumerSecret: '<CONSUMER_SECRET>',\ntokenUrl: '<TOKEN_URL>',\n};```\n\n2. **Read the Configuration:**\n```const serviceURL = window?.configs?.apiUrl ? window.configs.apiUrl : /;```\n\n3. **Acquire an OAuth 2.0 Access Token:**\n\n**Using a cURL Command:**\n```CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key\nCONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret\nTOKEN_URL=your_token_url\nCLIENT_CREDENTIALS=$(echo -n $CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET | base64)\ncurl -X POST $TOKEN_URL \n-H Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded \n-H Authorization: Basic $CLIENT_CREDENTIALS \n--data-urlencode grant_type=client_credentials```\n\n4. **Invoke the Service:**\n```const response = await axios.get(serviceURL/{RESOURCE_PATH}, {\nheaders: {\n'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`\n}\n});```\n\nBy following these steps, you can successfully add **authentication** to your service in **Choreo** using either **managed authentication** or **custom authentication** methods.",

Here are some approaches to testing each:\n\n#### Backend Testing\nYou can set up end-to-end tests using tools like `Cypress` or `Playwright`. Focus on testing:\n- **API requests**\n- **Server behavior**\n- **Database interactions**\n- **Authentication processes**\n\nFor example, if your backend exposes REST APIs, use tools like Postman to create API test cases.\n\n#### Frontend Testing\nTesting the frontend involves validating user interfaces and interactive elements. Use tools compatible with Choreo’s GitLab CI infrastructure:\n\n- **Playwright**: Write UI tests that can interact with your web application directly, simulating user actions.\n- **Cypress**: Useful for functional testing and provides capabilities to assert component states and user interactions.\n\nEnsure that your frontend and backend tests are isolated from one another, allowing for effective parallel execution.\n\n### 4. Monitor and Track Results\nAfter setting up your tests, monitor their execution and track the results through the Choreo Console. This will provide insights into the performance and reliability of your application.\n\n### Example Code Snippets\nHere are some example code snippets to illustrate how you can integrate testing using Playwright and Cypress:\n\n#### Playwright Example (end-to-end testing)\n```javascript\nconst { playwright } = require('@testing-tools/choreo');\n\ndescribe('Your feature', async () => {\n    // Set the application URL and optional HTTP headers\n    const config = {\n        url: 'https://your-web-app-url.choreoapps.dev/',\n        httpHeaders: {}\n    }\n\n    it('Visits home page and navigates through pages', async ({ page }) => {\n        // Navigate to the home page\n        await page.goto(config.url);\n\n        // Perform further navigation logic\n    });\n\n    it('Tests the login functionality', async ({ page }) => {\n        await page.login(config.url, 'username', 'password');\n    });\n\n    // More tests...\n});\n```\n\n#### Cypress Example\nCypress documentation provides guidance on creating integration tests. Here’s a simple integration test:\n```javascript\n/// <reference types=\"cypress\" />\n\nCypress.on('uncaught:exception', (err, runnable) => {\n  // Allow pages to run without crashing.\n  return false;\n});\n\ndescribe('Integration test', () => {\n  it('Logs in to your app', () => {\n    cy.visit('/login');\n    cy.get('#username').type('yourUsername');\n    cy.get('#password').type('yourPassword');\n    cy.get('#loginButton').click();\n\n    cy.url().should('include', '/home');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the documentation:\n- [Test your applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/testing/test-your-components-with-test-runner/)\n- [Automate cross-platform UI tests with Playwright](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/testing/automate-cross-platform-ui-tests-with-playwright/#generate-test-cases)\n- [CI/CD Testing Overview](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#test)\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively test both your frontend and backend components of a full-stack application within Choreo.",

         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, you need to follow these steps in the Choreo Console:\n\n1. **Select Your Project**:\n   - From the **Project** list, choose the project associated with your component.\n\n2. **Access the Deployment**:\n   - In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then select **Health Checks**. This will display the configured liveness and readiness probes for your component.\n\n3. **Create or Configure Readiness Probe**:\n   - Click on **+ Create** to add a new probe.\n   - You can configure various types of readiness probes, including:\n     - **HTTP `GET` Request**: This method sends an HTTP GET request to a specified port and path on the container. A successful response status code (200-399) indicates that the service is healthy. Make sure the service you expose is ready to handle traffic. You can set this at the project level, which applies the same readiness check across all environments.\n     - **TCP Connection Probe**: This attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a connection, it is considered a failure.\n     - **Execute a Command**: This runs a command inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure.\n\n4. **Apply Configuration**:\n   - After configuring the readiness probe, click **Save** to apply the changes.\n\n5. **View Running Instances**:\n   - To verify the readiness probe in action, navigate to the running instances page. Observe the states and logs of the running replicas. A failure to meet the readiness criteria may cause a replica to shut down, while a subsequent recovery may indicate a transient issue.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- The readiness probe is essential for ensuring that your application does not receive traffic if it is not healthy. For example, if a component is restarted due to a liveness probe failing, the readiness probe will prevent it from immediately receiving requests until it recovers.\n- Readiness checks run continuously, allowing for effective management of incoming traffic based on the component's readiness.\n\nFor detailed instructions and screenshots, you can refer to the following document: [Configure liveness and readiness probes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-liveness-and-readiness-probes).",
         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to configure readiness probes.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component. Using this method you can secure your web application.",

         "What are the steps to secure an API in Choreo?",
         "To secure APIs using role-based access control (RBAC) in Choreo, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Configure Role-Based Access Control\n1. **Define Roles**: Define roles that specify permissions for various operations. Choreo has built-in roles such as:\n   - **API Publisher**\n   - **API Subscriber**\n   - **API Admin**\n   \n2. **Attach Roles to Groups**: Attach these roles to specific groups within your organization. Each group can have multiple roles assigned.\n\n3. **Assign Roles to Users**: Allow users to assign roles to their respective groups. Ensure users are aware of which actions they can perform based on their assigned roles.\n\n### Step 2: Secure APIs\nThere are three main methods to secure your APIs:\n\n#### Option 1: Secure API Access Using Asgardeo\n1. In the **Components Listing** pane of Choreo Console, click **APIs** to view your APIs.\n2. Select the desired API, then go to the **Manage** tab and choose **Subscription Policies**.\n3. Choose **Asgardeo** as the identity provider and link it if necessary.\n4. Follow the prompts to create a subscription policy for your API.\n\n**Prerequisites**:\n- Create a user store in Asgardeo.\n- Enable the `WSO2_IM_EXTERNAL_AUTHORITY` add-on for your project.\n- Ensure the application in Asgardeo is linked to the Choreo API and has appropriate permissions.\n\n#### Option 2: Implement API Level Security with Asgardeo\n1. In Choreo, ensure you have created a project and added the API proxy component.\n2. Navigate to the **Deploy** section for your component and generate a token via the **Test** tab.\n3. Use this token to invoke the backend.\n\n### Step 3: Enable and Manage Security Features\n1. Navigate to your project in Choreo.\n2. Select the **API Proxy** from the components list and go to the **Deploy** section.\n3. Enable the necessary security features required for your API, such as API throttling.\n4. Manage security keys in the **Credentials** tab of the API component.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Choreo enforces the principle of least privilege, meaning applications should only use the minimum necessary permissions granted by roles.\n- It is advisable to avoid granting permissions at the individual user level and to manage user access through their associated roles.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively secure your APIs in Choreo using RBAC and other security measures.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the documentation: \n- [Secure API access using Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/#step-3-to-create-an-api-in-choreo)\n- [Implement API-level Security with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-role-based-access-control-for-consumers-of-a-sevice/#step-1-enable-asgardeo-for-the-api-proxy-in-choreo)\n- [Manage Security Features](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/manage-security-features/)",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Below are the general steps for each approach: Securing API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: In the Component Listing pane, click on your API component. Navigate to Manage > Permissions. Click + Add Permission (Scope). Enter the permission value in the Permission List pane and click + Add New. Copy the fully qualified name of the scope for future reference. Attach the scope to a resource by selecting it from the Select Permissions list under the respective resource. Click Save and Deploy. Navigate to Manage > Lifecycle. Click Publish to publish your API to the Choreo Developer Portal. Create an API and Application in Azure AD: Follow Azure AD documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Azure AD API. Enable External IdP Authentication in Choreo: Create an application in Choreo and configure it to use Azure AD as an external IdP. Invoke the API with Scopes: Use the assigned scopes to authenticate and authorize API invocations. For detailed steps, refer to the Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) documentation. Securing API Access with Asgardeo Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: Similar to the Azure AD steps, assign scopes to your API in Choreo by navigating to Manage > Permissions and following the same steps to add permissions. Create an API and Application in Asgardeo: Follow Asgardeo documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Asgardeo API. Enable External IdP Authentication in Choreo: Create an application in Choreo and configure it to use Asgardeo as an external IdP. Invoke the API with Scopes: Use the assigned scopes to authenticate and authorize API invocations. For detailed steps, refer to the Secure API Access with Asgardeo documentation.",

Click **Enable** in the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler** section. Note that the scale-to-zero feature will be disabled when horizontal scaling is enabled at the project level.\n\n### 2. Implement Dynamic Port Configuration\nApplications within a project must have configurable ports for scaling to occur:\n\n- For service endpoints created before September 15, 2022:\n  - The endpoint must have a single port defined (the project homepage will display the endpoint’s network visibility).\n  - To change the port mapping, go to the **Deploy** page of your component and update the endpoint port under **Update Image & Deploy**.\n\n- For service endpoints created after September 15, 2022:\n  - Any number of ports can be configured, provided at least one endpoint is tagged with the **scale-to-container** label in its network visibility settings.\n\n### 3. Set Up Automatic Scaling\nTo set up automatic scaling based on CPU, memory, and requests:\n\n- In the left navigation menu, click on **Overview**, then **DevOps**, and finally **Autoscale**.\n- Click on **Configure** and specify the minimum and maximum pod count.\n- Configure scale-to-zero if necessary. When enabled, your application will automatically scale down to zero at the end of the idle time window and remain inactive.\n\nBy following these steps, you will be able to enable automatic scaling for your applications effectively. For further details, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/overview/#autoscale-an-application).",

Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1.

         "In Choreo, you can effectively limit the requests coming to your API using various strategies depending on your requirements. Here are some key approaches:\n\n### Rate Limiting\nChoreo's built-in rate-limiting component is designed to help prevent abuse and ensure optimal performance for your services. By enabling rate limiting, you can set up constraints that restrict the number of requests made within a defined time frame, thus helping to avoid denial-of-service attacks. \n\n#### How to Enable Rate Limiting:\n1. Navigate to the component you wish to manage in the **Component Listing** pane.\n2. Go to the left navigation menu and select **Deploy**.\n3. In the **Set Up** card, click on **Rate Limiting**.\n4. Choose from three available rate-limiting options:\n   - **API Key**: Applies rate limits across all operations if only an API Key is enforced.\n   - **No Rate Limiting**: Allows unlimited calls but does not apply to development and trial environments.\n   - **Per Method Rate Limiting**: Allows setting specific rate limits per method, which is particularly useful for protecting critical API paths.\n\n5. Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the changes.\n6. Redeploy the component for the new rate-limiting settings to take effect.\n\nFor more detailed steps, refer to the documentation: [Rate Limiting Traffic](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/#enable-rate-limiting).\n\n### IP Blacklisting/Whitelisting\nIf you prefer more granular control over incoming traffic based on client IPs, you can configure IP blacklisting or whitelisting.\n\n#### Steps to Configure IP Access Control:\n1. Go to the **Overview** page of the component in the Choreo Console.\n2. Under the **Set Up** card, click **Endpoint Configurations**.\n3. Expand the relevant endpoint to configure the access rules.\n4. Click the edit icon next to the relevant environment to open the **Endpoint Configuration Editor** pane.\n5. To add a new rule, click **+ Add New** and specify:\n   - **IP Address or Range**: The allowed IP address or CIDR block.\n   - **Direction**: Whether the rule applies to incoming traffic (inbound) or outgoing traffic (outbound).\n6. Click **Add** to save the rule.\n\nThis allows you to fine-tune how your API responds to traffic based on source IP addresses. For further details, check out the documentation: [Secure API Access with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-managed-authentication/#step-4-configure-ip-access-control).\n\nBy leveraging these methods, you can effectively manage and limit the requests to your API within Choreo.",

         "I get build errors during vulnerability scan stage",
         "When encountering build errors during the vulnerability scan stage in Choreo, it can significantly impact your deployment process. Here’s how you can troubleshoot this issue effectively:\n\n1. **Understand the Vulnerability Scan Process**: Choreo uses a non-intrusive scan to check for security vulnerabilities in the components within a project. The scans happen continuously in the background. However, if a component is deployed and has connections open, a scan cannot be initiated on that component.\n\n2. **Check for Specific Errors**:\n   - Review the error messages in the Choreo Console. They should provide insights into what might be causing the build to fail during the scan.\n   - If the scan fails due to a specific vulnerability, you may need to update your code or configurations accordingly.\n\n3. **Build Configurations and Secrets**: \n   - Ensure that sensitive information like API keys, secrets, and passwords is stored securely using Choreo's secrets manager instead of being included directly in your build context. This can sometimes cause issues if not handled correctly.\n   - If you encounter any unauthorized access errors from a third-party service while reading these configurations, check how you are accessing them.\n\n4. **Manual Triggering of Builds**: \n   - If the build fails automatically when scanning for vulnerabilities, you might need to manually trigger builds when updating dependencies or configurations.\n   - Use the CI/CD pipeline settings in Choreo to configure your builds properly so that they integrate smoothly with vulnerability scans.\n\n5. **Review Logs and Notifications**: \n   - Check Choreo logs for any detailed logs that could offer more insight into the vulnerabilities detected. This can assist in identifying the root cause of the failure.\n\n6. **Adjust Component Deployments**: \n   - If deploying multiple components to the same environment simultaneously causes vulnerabilities to be ignored, consider deploying each component individually if necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and potentially resolve the issues you're facing during the vulnerability scan stage. For more details, you can refer to the documentation here: [Build Vulnerability Scanning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/reliability-and-security/security-scanners/#build-vulnerability-scan).",

         "I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely?",
         "To securely manage secret keys as configurations for your React web app in Choreo, follow these guidelines:\n\n### 1. Use Configurations Instead of Secrets\nChoreo recommends using **configurations** instead of secrets whenever possible. Configurations can be updated via the UI without requiring a new deployment or a rolling restart. However, once you create a configuration and apply it, it cannot be changed without recreating the component.\n\n### 2. Securely Manage Configurations\nHere are some best practices for managing configurations:\n- **Environment Variables**: For configurations like API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data, set them as environment variables rather than hard-coding them in your source code. This ensures that sensitive information is not exposed directly within the application.\n  \n  To do this, navigate to the **Deploy** section in the Choreo console, then click on **Configure & Deploy**. In the **Configurations** pane, select **Environment Variables** and specify the necessary variables.\n  \n  ![Configure & Deploy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-and-deploy-step-4.png)\n  \n  ![Define environment variables](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/define-environment-variables-for-a-container.png)\n  \n- **Configuring Secrets**: If you need to configure a secret (e.g., a password), proceed as follows:\n  - Navigate to **Deploy** > **Configure & Deploy** > **Configurations**.\n  - Select **Secrets** in the **Select Configuration Type** pane.\n  - Enter the necessary secrets and click **Next**.\n  - Attach any files as configurations if needed.\n  - Click **Deploy** to apply the changes.\n\n### 3. Use Configurations to Pass Secrets to APIs\nWhen consuming third-party services, you can pass credentials securely using configurations. For more details, refer to the following documentation: [Passing Configuration Values to Your Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-and-pass-values-to-services/#pass-configuration-values-to-your-service).\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively manage your secret keys securely in Choreo.\n\nFor further reading, visit the relevant sections in the documentation: [Manage Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#use-configurations-instead-of-secrets).",
         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it.

         "To protect your web application in Choreo, you can implement various strategies to enhance security. Here are some key measures and practices:\n\n1. **Implement HTTPS**: Ensure that your web application uses HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and protects sensitive information.\n\n2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Utilize secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. You can leverage industry standards such as OAuth 2.0 for managing user access and permissions.\n\n3. **Secure API Usage**: When interacting with APIs, ensure they are secure. Use API gateways that offer features like API security, access control, and traffic management.\n\n4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Perform regular vulnerability scanning of both the frontend and backend of your application to identify any security loopholes.\n\n5. **Use Latest Software Updates**: Keep all libraries and frameworks used in your application up to date to avoid vulnerabilities associated with older versions.\n\n6. **Sensitive Data Handling**: Minimize the storage of sensitive user data. If necessary, ensure that this data is encrypted at rest.\n\n7. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging to detect and respond to potential security incidents promptly. \n\n8. **Regular Security Training**: Conduct regular training for developers about security best practices and new threats.\n\n9. **Compliance and Security Policies**: Familiarize yourself with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and ensure your application complies with them regarding data privacy and protection.\n\nFor more detailed steps on how to configure these security measures within Choreo, refer to the [Choreo documentation on securing web applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/secure-web-applications-with-choreo-built-in-security-services/).",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

         "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?",
         "In Choreo, there are several methods you can use to protect an API:\n\n1. **API Scope Control**: This feature allows you to manage fine-grained access control for APIs. By defining scopes, API publishers can grant varying levels of access to specific functionality, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can invoke specific operations. \n\n   - **Process**:\n     1. Define scopes when you create your API specification or update existing ones.\n     2. Attach these scopes to API resources during the deployment phase.\n     3. Utilize security tokens that contain scope permissions for API invocations.\n\n2. **Authentication Mechanisms**: You can apply various authentication processes to secure API access. Some common approaches include OAuth 2.0 authorization, which supports various grant types tailored to different application scenarios. For instance, you can implement:\n   - **Application (client) credentials grant** for automated applications.\n   - **Refresh token grant** for user-based applications.\n\n3. **Secure Communication**: To ensure data privacy and integrity, you should use HTTPS when invoking APIs, as it encrypts the communication between the client and server.\n\n4. **Managed Authentication with Asgardeo**: Choreo also integrates with Asgardeo for managing API security. This integration provides streamlined management of user authentication and access control, simplifying the implementation of API protection.\n\nThese methods collectively enable you to securely expose your APIs while adhering to best practices.\n\nFor more detailed information on implementing API scope control and using managed authentication, you can refer to the following links:\n- [Protect API Access with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/protect-api-access-with-managed-authentication/#enable-managed-authentication-for-your-api)\n- [Implement Fine-Grained Access Control with Choreo API Scope Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-choreo-api-scope-control/#step-1-configure-the-scopes-for-the-api).",

Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information about your specific issue to provide a detailed response on how to prevent service overload. If you could provide more details or context about your service and the challenges you're facing, I'll do my best to assist you. For general information regarding managing services, you can check [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-an-application/#deploy-the-service-and-manage-workloads) for best practices related to deployments and workloads.",
         "Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon. Expand the Rate Limiting section under Manage. Select a Rate Limiting Level and click Apply. Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count. For API Proxy components, the process differs slightly. After step 2, click the settings icon next to API Configuration and proceed directly to selecting the Rate Limiting Level.",

    "\"To resolve the \\\"Module not found error\\\" during the deployment of a Python project in Choreo, you can try the following strategies:\\n\\n### 1. **Update Pip Cache**\\nSometimes, the module might not be recognized due to caching issues. You can try to clear the pip cache before installing your dependencies.\\n\\n```bash\\npip3 clean --all\\n```\\n\\nThen proceed with installing your dependencies as usual:\\n\\n```bash\\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\nThis approach helps ensure that the latest packages are fetched and installed correctly.\\n\\n### 2. **Use a Requirements File**\\nEnsure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your source directory containing all the required libraries for your application. This file should list all dependencies needed for your project.\\n\\nA sample `requirements.txt` file may look like this:\\n\\n```\\nflask==2.0.2\\nrequests==2.26.0\\n```\\n\\nMake sure to commit this file along with your code.\\n\\n### 3. **Buildpack Configuration**\\nIf the above methods do not work, you may need to configure the buildpack for your specific project. However, note that this option is available only if your repository contains a supported buildpack for your project.\\n\\n#### Steps to Configure Buildpacks:\\n- **Select Component Area**: Navigate to the area where you want to set the buildpack configuration.\\n- **Choose Buildpack**: In the **Build Configurations** pane, select **Configure with Buildpack** and specify the buildpack that works best for your application.\\n- **Additional Arguments**: You can input additional arguments in the text box, though this is typically used only for experimental purposes or setting environment variables for a buildpack.\\n\\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to the relevant section in the documentation: [Build components with buildpacks](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/bring-your-own-code/#build-components-with-buildpacks).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nBy following these suggestions, you should be able to address the \\\"Module not found error\\\" and successfully deploy your Python project in Choreo. If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about the error messages for further assistance.\",\n",
    "\"To implement and manage authentication for your services in Choreo, follow these structured steps:\\n\\n### 1. Implement Authentication for REST APIs\\nYou can use an external security token service like Choreo Auth for REST API authentication or integrate any OIDC/OAuth 2.0 compatible Identity Provider (IdP).\\n\\n#### Steps to Configure:\\n1. **Enable Security**: Navigate to your component's **Deployment** page and click on the **Configure & Deploy** option.\\n2. **Add Security Context**: On the **Set Up** card, choose the type of context required for your service (OAuth2 Application or OIDC/OAuth2). \\n3. **Identity Provider**: Select Choreo Auth as your identity provider and fill in the relevant details such as `Access Token Key` and `Access Token Issuer`.\\n4. **Additional Configurations**: Set other required parameters and finalize the configuration.\\n\\nLearn more about implementing Choreo Auth: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-choreo-auth-for-your-rest-api).\\n\\n### 2. Manage OAuth Scopes\\n- Define scopes that control access based on specific resource permissions, allowing you to fine-tune permissions for different service endpoints.\\n- This is crucial for implementing role-based access control (RBAC) effectively.\\n\\nLearn more about managing OAuth scopes: [Define Secure APIs with Roles and Scopes](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/manage-roles-and-scopes-for-api-access/#generate-an-access-token-to-test-the-authorization).\\n\\n### 3. Generate Credentials and Invocations\\nAfter securing your API with OAuth, generate credentials for testing purposes and invoke your secured service:\\n- Under the **Manage** tab of your component, click **Endpoints** to get the invoke URL.\\n- To invoke the service, use a POST request with appropriate header keys, values, payload, and OAuth2 tokens if applicable.\\n\\nMore details on generating keys and invoking services: [Develop a Web Application with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-a-web-application-with-managed-authentication/#step-4-generate-keys-and-invoke-the-service).\\n\\n### 4. Enable Real-Sample Scenarios (for PDP)\\nIf you are using the Private Data Plane (PDP), you need to enable real-sample scenarios to test authentication:\\n1. Click **Authentication Settings** under the **Manage** tab of your component.\\n2. Turn on the toggle for real-sample scenarios.\\n3. Redeploy the application from the left navigation menu after enabling it.\\n\\nFurther information: [Test the Real-Sample Scenario for Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/test-real-sample-scenario-for-managed-authentication/#enable-real-sample-scenario-to-test-managed-authentication).\\n\\n### Additional Resources\\nFor further insights, check the following documentation links:\\n- [Consume an External OAuth2 Secured Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/consume-an-external-oauth2-seeded-service/#securely-consume-the-service-through-choreo)\\n- [Secure REST APIs with Choreo Built-In Security Token Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-restapis-with-built-in-security-token-service/#generate-an-access-token-for-testing)\\n- [Secure Communication between Microservices](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-communication-between-microservices/#generate-an-access-token-for-testing)\\n- [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#set-up-choreo-auth-for-your-rest-api)\\n- [Consume an OpenID Connect Secured Service](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/consuming-an-external-idp-backed-rest-service/#consume-an-opentid-connect-seeded-service)\\n- [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/role-based-access-control/) \\n\\nBy following these steps, you will be able to implement and manage authentication for your services effectively within Choreo.\",\n",

    "\"To control API access in Choreo, including restricting it to only administrators, you can manage the permissions associated with the API. This process involves setting the permissions for which roles can access the API resources.\\n\\nHere's how you can restrict your API to allow only admin users to view it:\\n\\n1. **Deploy Your Service**:\\n   - Make sure your API component is deployed. If not, navigate to the **Deploy** section in the Choreo Console and configure the deployment settings based on your project requirements.\\n\\n2. **Configure Roles and Permissions**:\\n   - In the left navigation menu, click on **Manage** and then select **Roles**.\\n   - Create a new role if needed, for example, let's call it `AdminRole`.\\n   - Attach the appropriate permissions to the `AdminRole`. Specifically, you should attach the `edit_api_info` permission, which allows users with this role to update the API info in production.\\n\\n3. **Assign Roles to Users**:\\n   - You can assign the `AdminRole` to users or groups who need admin-level access. This can be done either by inviting new users and adding them to the relevant group or managing existing users within an organization group.\\n\\n4. **Restrict Access in the UI**:\\n   - To ensure that only admins can view the API, you can configure the UI permissions under the **Web Application Security Settings** when developing a single-page web application using Choreo. However, since you're focusing on API access, step 3 is more relevant.\\n\\n5. **Testing Access**:\\n   - After setting up, test the API access by ensuring that only users with the `AdminRole` can perform the necessary actions. \\n\\nFor further details on configuring roles, permissions, and testing API access, refer to the documentation on controlling API access: [Control API Access](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/control-api-access/#sample-scenario).\\n\\nAdditionally, you can find specific steps related to role management and permissions in the following link: [Configure Roles and Permissions](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-organization-wide-roles-and-permissions/).\",\n",
    "\"To get started with using Choreo CLI on your computer, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n### Step 1: Install the Choreo CLI\\nYou need to have either `npm` or `yarn` installed on your machine. If you already have one of these, you can proceed to install the Choreo CLI.\\n\\n**Using npm:**\\n1. Open your terminal.\\n2. Run the following command:\\n   ```sh\\n   sudo npm install -g wso2choreo-cli\\n   ```\\n\\n**Using yarn:**\\n1. Open your terminal.\\n2. Run the following command:\\n   ```sh\\n   sudo yarn global add wso2choreo-cli\\n   ```\\n\\n### Step 2: Create a Project with the CLI\\nOnce the CLI is installed, you can create a project using the following commands:\\n\\n1. Choose your preferred project type (like Service, Web Application, etc.) and generate it using a template. For example, to create a service:\\n   ```sh\\n   choreo create service --name my-first-service --project-name MyFirstProject --build-configs='key1=value1,key2=value2'\\n   ```\\n\\n2. After creating the project, navigate to the project directory:\\n   ```sh\\n   cd my-first-service\\n   ```\\n\\n3. To verify that the project is created correctly, list your projects:\\n   ```sh\\n   choreo list projects\\n   ```\\n\\n4. To update your project settings if necessary, you can use:\\n   ```sh\\n   choreo config update --project-name MyFirstProject --build-configs='key1=new_value1'\\n   ```\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n- Ensure you have an internet connection as the CLI will need to download templates and other resources.\\n- You may need administrator privileges depending on your system setup.\\n\\nFor more detailed information and available commands, you can always run:\\n```sh\\nchoreo --help\\n```\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully set up and use the Choreo CLI on your computer.\",\n",
    "\"To enable automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you can utilize the HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) feature.
