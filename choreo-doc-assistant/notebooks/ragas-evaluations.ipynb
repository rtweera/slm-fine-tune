In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\\n5. Click **Save**. \\n\\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\\n\\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\\n\\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\\n\\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\\\"\\\"cat\\\"\\\", \\\"\\\"/tmp/healthy\\\"\\\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\\n\\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.\",\n",

    "\"To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs.

    "\"To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1.

You can create a config file mount via the Configurations pane on the Deploy page in the Choreo Console.\",\n",
    "\"To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

    "\"To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.\",\n",
    "\"Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon. Expand the Rate Limiting section under Manage. Select a Rate Limiting Level and click Apply. Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count.

         "The \"Module not found error\" typically occurs when your application cannot locate or access the necessary libraries or files that it needs to run properly. This issue can occur both at the time of deployment and while running the deployed application. Here are some strategies you can use to resolve this error:\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot and Resolve Module Not Found Errors During Deployment:\n\n1. **Verify File Paths**: Ensure that all required files (such as configurations, scripts, etc.) are stored in the correct directory. Sometimes, relative paths may cause the module to be inaccessible.\n\n   Example: If your `main.py` is located in `/my/project/main.py`, make sure that any other files or directories are accessible through the same path.\n\n2. **Check Libraries**: Confirm that all dependencies are included correctly. Missing or incorrectly referenced third-party libraries can cause a `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n\n   - Make sure your Dockerfile contains commands to install any necessary dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` (if you're using a Python project). For example:\n     ```bash\ncp requirements.txt .\npip install --upgrade pip\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n3. **Dockerfile Structure**: If you are using a Dockerfile, ensure it follows best practices:\n\n   - Use an explicit `WORKDIR` to avoid potential confusion with environment variables.\n   - Ensure the command section is clean and separates from the `COPY` section for better readability and maintainability.\n   \n   ```Dockerfile\nFROM python:3.7\nRUN cp requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt\nCOPY . /app\nWORKDIR /app\nENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"main.py\"]\n# Add other commands here if needed\n``` \n\n4. **Container Image Build Failure**: If there are issues during container image build, the command will return with a non-zero exit status, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. To troubleshoot:\n\n   - Clean the cache before building (`docker build -f <path-to-Dockerfile> -t <image-name>:<tag> -ci .`).\n   - Check if there are any permission errors or file corruption during the build process.\n\n5. **CI/CD Process**: Ensure your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes are configured correctly:\n\n   - Check if your component has set up a proper build pack. The build pack handles compiling your code, packaging it into a container image, and pushing it to your preferred cloud environment.\n   - Verify that all environment variables are properly defined and assigned to their respective components.\n\n6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Use logging and monitoring tools within your Choreo Console to track any deployment failures and monitor application logs for clues.\n\n### Common Error Messages:\n- **No module named 'some_module'**: This indicates that `some_module.py` cannot be found.\n- **Error reading the manifest file**: This may occur if there are missing or incorrectly formatted dependencies.\n\nFor more detailed troubleshooting, you can refer to the following links in the Choreo documentation:\n- [Builds & Deployments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build-and-deploy)\n- [Build a Container Image From Scratch](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/create-container-image-from-scratch/)",
         "To resolve a **Module not found** error during the deployment of a Python project in Choreo:\n\n1. **Verify Dependencies:**\n - Ensure all required Python modules are in `requirements.txt`\n - Example `requirements.txt`:\n ```plaintext\n flask\n requests\n numpy\n ```\n\n2. **Check File Paths:**\n - Verify that the modules and packages being imported in your Python code have the correct file paths\n\n3. **Rebuild the Component:**\n - Trigger a rebuild after updating `requirements.txt` or file paths. This will ensure that any changes made to the dependencies are included in the new build.\n\n4. **Inspect Logs:**\n - . If the error persists check build logs in Choreo Console UI for detailed error messages. The logs can provide more context on which module is not found and why. \n\n5. **Environment Configuration:**\n - Ensure correct setup of environment variables in Choreo. Sometimes environment variables might be needed for certain modules to work correctly.you can follow these steps:\n\n**Steps to Implement Custom Authentication:**\n\n1. **Add the Connection Configuration:**\n```window.configs = {\napiUrl: '<SERVICE_URL>'",

         "To enhance the security and privacy of your service interactions in Choreo, incorporating authentication mechanisms is essential. Here’s how to configure basic security for REST services, which can then be extended to service-to-service and service-to-user communication.\n\n### Adding Basic Security to a Service\n\n1. **Select Your Component**: In the Choreo Console, locate the component you wish to secure. If you need to generate new credentials, navigate to **Deploy** > **Endpoint Configurations** under the **Set Up** card.\n\n2. **Define Endpoints**: Identify the endpoints that require protection from unauthorized access. Ensure these endpoints include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or TRACE operations, as they may be exposed via standard API proxies.\n\n3. **Configure Endpoint Scopes**: Specify scopes for each endpoint. These are identifiers that describe permissions attached to a resource. This is crucial because you will later apply roles to these scopes during role-based access control. Note that scopes must be defined explicitly, similar to setting tags for a cloud-native database connection. Use appropriate names for scopes to define permissions effectively.\n\n4. **Set Authentication Level**: In the **Deploy** section, select **Basic Security with OAuth** as the authentication level. Configure the necessary options for this method, including selecting your identity provider.\n\n5. **Protect the Endpoint**: To test your secured endpoint, go back to the **Develop** section, click on **Test**, set up test users, and initiate a test request. Upon successful deployment, the Invoke page will display details about the deployed endpoint.\n\n### Extending Authentication\n\nOnce basic authentication is configured, it’s advisable to upgrade your component to an OAuth application if you plan on implementing a full OAuth2.0 flow. This allows you to manage user tokens effectively and handle API subscriptions more rigorously.\n\nFor detailed guidance on configuring an Identity Provider for your service, please refer to the [Choreo documentation on adding basic authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-basic-authentication-for-a-component/#step-3-set-up-the-identity-provider-for-your-component).\n\nBy following these steps, you can secure your service with appropriate measures ensuring safe interaction and enhanced protection against unauthorized access.",

         "Tell me how I can configure a readiness probe?",
         "In Choreo, you can configure various probe types for setting up a readiness probe to manage the health status of your Containerized Application (CCA). Here are some key configurations for the readiness probe:\n\n### Types of Probe\n1. **HTTP GET Request**: \n   - This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A successful response status code is in the range of 200-399.\n   - **Sample script**: `\n      |curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X GET -d {}\n      |--http-port\n      |<port>\n      |<path>`\n   - **Configuration**: [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-an-http-get-request-body)\n\n2. **TCP Connection Probe**:\n   - This probe establishes a TCP connection on the specified port. If it cannot open a socket, it is considered a failure.\n   - **Sample script**: `\n      |[[[probe-tcp-connection-port]]] <port> [\n      |<port>]`\n   - **Configuration**: [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-a-tcp-connection-body)\n\n3. **Execute a Command**: \n   - Executes a given command inside the container. A non-zero return from the command indicates a failure.\n   - **Sample script**: `|[command]`\n   - **Configuration**: [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-an-execute-a-command-body)\n\n4. **File Creation Probe**: \n   - Checks if a specific file exists at a designated location in the container. If not found, it is considered a failure.\n   - **Sample script**: `|-p [/absolute/path/to/file]|[\n       |[-m|--must-exist] |[\n       |[-n|--no-to-file]|[\n       |<directory>]`\n   - **Configuration**: [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/#configure-create-a-file-body)\n\n### Steps to Configure Readiness Probes\n1. In the Choreo Console, navigate to **DevOps** and then **Health Checks** under the **Probe Configurations** tab.\n2. Click on **+ Create** to add a new probe configuration.\n3. Choose the type of probe that best suits your needs (HTTP, TCP, Execute Command, or File Creation).\n4. Specify the necessary parameters for the selected probe type, and save your settings.\n\nBy properly configuring the readiness probes, you ensure that your containerized applications receive proper health checks, allowing effective management of application availability in the Choreo environment.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the [Set Up Health Checks documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/set-up-health-checks/).",
         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to configure readiness probes.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

         "How can I secure my web app?",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, there are several steps you can take depending on your specific needs regarding security measures. Here’s a structured approach:\n\n### 1. Implement Authentication\nAuthentication is crucial for securing web applications as it verifies the user’s identity before granting access. The following methods can be used:\n\n   - **Ballerina Built-In Security Token Service**\n     - Set up the Ballerina built-in security token service to manage API keys securely.\n     - Use API key-based security to restrict resource access via project scopes.\n   - **WSO2 Identity Server**\n     - Integrate Choreo components with the WSO2 Identity server for user authentication.\n     - Create users in the identity server, assign roles, and configure an OIDC/OAuth 2.0 authentication flow to protect your resources.\n\n   **Steps to set up Ballerina Built-In Security Token Service**: \n   1. Go to the Choreo console, click on your organization, and select Settings.\n   2. Navigate to the Access Tokens tab, choose to enable Secure Token Storage, and configure the path for the security token file.\n\n   **Steps to integrate WSO2 Identity Server**:\n   1. In the Choreo console, navigate to Settings under Organization.\n   2. Go to the Application Security tab and create a Security Token Handler.\n   3. Assign roles to specific groups through the Identity Provider management under Role Management.\n\n### 2. Implement Authorization\nAuthorization determines who can perform what actions on your web application. You can manage this through roles and permissions.\n\n   - **Define Roles**: Assign roles to users, allowing them to inherit the permissions associated with those roles. For instance, grant admin privileges to selected users.\n   - **Set Permissions**: Assign permissions to roles. This ensures that only designated users can execute specific operations based on their roles.\n\n   **Steps to define Roles and Permissions**: \n   1. Under Organization, go to Settings and then Application Security.\n   2. Click to add new roles and map permissions to these roles.\n\n### 3. Encrypt Data at Rest\nTo protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, it's essential to encrypt it both in transit and at rest.\n\n- **Enable Transport Layer Encryption**: \n  - For API Gateways, ensure that transport layer encryption is enabled across major cloud providers and private data planes.\n  - Implement TLS certificates to secure connections.\n\n- **Encryption at Rest**: \n  - Enable storage encryption for databases like MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Cassandra.\n\n### 4. Monitor and Alert Configuration\nImplementing monitoring and alert configurations can help detect and mitigate threats:\n\n- **Configure Alerts**: \n  - Create alerts to monitor specific metrics like CPU and memory usage thresholds and set notification levels accordingly.\n  - Subscribe to logs to gain insights into any potential breaches.\n\n### Additional Tips\n- Regularly review and update your application’s security measures to stay ahead of emerging threats.\n- Consider using OAuth 2.0 for better authorization practices and API security.\n\nFor further details on configuring authentication, authorization, encryption, and setting up monitoring and alerts in Choreo, please refer to the [Choreo Security Documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/authentication-and-authorization-overview/#set-up-basic-authentication-and-secure-api-access).",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component.

         "What are the steps to secure an API in Choreo?",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can utilize various methods that incorporate built-in security functions or implement JWT-based security tokens. Here’s a comprehensive guide on how to secure an API:\n\n### 1. **Use Built-In Security Functions for API Level Authentication**\n   - When creating an API component in Choreo, you have the option to enable security through the following mechanisms:\n     - **Basic Authentication**: For this, set the `username` and `password` fields to define who can access the API. \n     - **Bearer Token Authentication**: Generate a secret key and attach it to the endpoint URL to ensure secure communication.\n   - To configure these settings:\n     1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the REST API you want to secure.\n     2. In the left navigation menu, click **Develop**, then select **Endpoints**.\n     3. Under **Security Overview**, click **Configure New Token** to set up appropriate roles and assign them to specific endpoints.\n\n### 2. **Implement JWT-Based API Security**\n   - To implement JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for securing APIs:\n   - Ensure you have an identity provider (IdP) set up, which can either be built-in or an external IdP. Choreo supports popular IdPs like Asgardeo, Azure AD, AWS Identity and Access Management, GitHub, and OpenID Connect applications.\n   - In the Choreo Console, navigate to the project level under **Settings** > **Authentication Keys** and generate the necessary keys to test your JWT implementation.\n   - After deployment, you can invoke the API securely via the generated endpoint URL. \n\n### 3. **Deploying Your Application**\n   - Once you have secured your API component, you need to deploy it to create the necessary keys for testing. This involves:\n   - Creating an API in Developer Portal: \n     1. Click on the API component in the **Component Listing** pane.\n     2. Click **Manage**, then select **Endpoint** and copy the endpoint URL.\n   - Invoking the API with the generated token to test its functionality.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- Always ensure that the application is deployed before attempting to generate the test URL and invoking the API.\n- Properly handle secrets and tokens to maintain security throughout the API lifecycle.\n\nFor further details on this topic, please refer to the official documentation:\n- [Secure API Access](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access/)\n- [Secure an HTTP Service with Managed Identity](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-an-http-service-with-managed-idp/#step-4-generate-the-secrete-token-and-attach-it-to-the-http-service-endpoint) \n- [Configure Endpoints for Your API](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/tutorials/expose-a-service-as-a-managed-api/#configure-endpoints-for-your-api)",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Below are the general steps for each approach: Securing API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: In the Component Listing pane, click on your API component. Navigate to Manage > Permissions. Click + Add Permission (Scope). Enter the permission value in the Permission List pane and click + Add New. Copy the fully qualified name of the scope for future reference. Attach the scope to a resource by selecting it from the Select Permissions list under the respective resource. Click Save and Deploy. Navigate to Manage > Lifecycle. Click Publish to publish your API to the Choreo Developer Portal. Create an API and Application in Azure AD: Follow Azure AD documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Azure AD API. Enable External IdP Authentication in Choreo: Create an application in Choreo and configure it to use Azure AD as an external IdP. Invoke the API with Scopes: Use the assigned scopes to authenticate and authorize API invocations. For detailed steps, refer to the Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) documentation. Securing API Access with Asgardeo Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: Similar to the Azure AD steps, assign scopes to your API in Choreo by navigating to Manage > Permissions and following the same steps to add permissions. Create an API and Application in Asgardeo: Follow Asgardeo documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Asgardeo API. Enable External IdP Authentication in Choreo: Create an application in Choreo and configure it to use Asgardeo as an external IdP. Invoke the API with Scopes: Use the assigned scopes to authenticate and authorize API invocations. For detailed steps, refer to the Secure API Access with Asgardeo documentation.",

         "Yes, users can set usage limits for APIs based on different API tiers in Choreo, allowing for varied access permissions depending on subscription types. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **API Tiers**: You can define different tiers for your APIs, each with unique subscription models and associated usage limits.\n  \n2. **Usage Limit Settings**:\n   - For every API tier, you can set:\n     - Minimum invocation count\n     - Maximum invocation count\n     - Request time limit (in minutes)\n\n3. **Automatic Enforcement**:\n   - Once you configure the usage limits and create an API component with that specific API tier, those limits will be enforced automatically for all users purchasing plans under that tier.\n\n### Steps to Configure API Usage Limits:\nTo configure API usage limits, follow these general steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the component you want to manage.\n2. Access the API settings and ensure that `BOTH` mode is enabled in the access control settings. This allows backend authentication tokens to be used without specifying an OAuth scope.\n3. Set up API usage limits according to the selected API tier, including defining:\n   - `maxInvocations`: The maximum number of allowed requests within a specified timeframe. A common setting is `500` requests per minute.\n   - `timeUnit`: Choose the desired time unit (such as minutes).\n   - `requestTimeLimitInMinutes`: Specify the request time limit in minutes.\n\n4. Save your changes.\n\n5. Publish your API component to apply the settings.\n\n6. Create an API plan with the applicable tiers and assign the appropriate limits for those tiers.\n\n7. Finally, promote the API to production and deploy the backend service.\n\n### Visual Representation:\n![Configure API Usage Limits](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/administer/configure-api-usage-limits.png)\n\nFor more detailed information and guidance, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-api-usage-limits/).",

Choreo automatically applies certain rate-limiting settings to improve the performance and stability of your deployments. While Choreo does enforce rate limits, it does not allow for customization via configuration files or source code. The specific rate limits vary depending on the region and environment you are in:\n\n| Region  | Default Rate Limit for API Requests | Default Rate Limit for WebSocket Connections |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| US-South| 10 requests per second            | 10 requests per second                   |\n| EU       | 30 requests per second            | 10 requests per second                   |\n| US-East | 30 requests per second            | 10 requests per second                   |\n\nIf your application consumes a significant number of outgoing messages, you may also encounter throttling for outgoing request traffic, which might affect performance. This default behavior may not meet the requirements of critical applications, so you should consider implementing additional measures if needed.\n\nFor more detailed information about managing incoming and outgoing traffic, please refer to the [Control Traffic](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/control-traffic/) documentation.",

Both modes help ensure that the load on your backend is managed effectively. Here’s how you can apply each:\n\n### Request Throttling\n- **Definition**: This mode limits the number of requests allowed during a specified time window.\n- **How it Works**: You set a threshold, and Choreo automatically adjusts based on this limit, allowing requests without further restrictions once the quota is met.\n- **Use Cases**: Ideal for situations where you want to prevent unexpected spikes in traffic, particularly during promotional periods or for testing purposes.\n\n![Request throttling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/api-management/manage-api-traffic/request-throttling.png)\n\n- **Important Consideration**: It’s essential to configure user-based quotas to avoid blocking legitimate requests unnecessarily.\n\n### Rate Limiting\n- **Definition**: Rate limiting controls the maximum number of requests allowed within a given timeframe.\n- **How it Works**: It prevents single users from overwhelming your backend service. By setting specific rate limits, you can ensure that critical services remain responsive and available to users.\n- **Use Cases**: Suitable when managing sudden traffic spikes, ensuring optimal performance, and protecting your services against abuse.\n- **Advanced Configuration**: In addition to basic settings, you can apply custom headers to better manage request flow.\n\n![Rate-limiting settings](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/api-management/manage-api-traffic/configure-rate-limiting.png)\n\n### Implementation Steps\n1.

         "To perform vulnerability scanning in Choreo using Trivy, there are different approaches depending on whether your component is a service or a Web Application. Here's a step-by-step guide for each scenario:\n\n### Vulnerability Scanning Methodologies\n\n1. **Built-in Vulnerability Scanner**:\n   - This scans your container images to detect vulnerabilities.\n   - The default behavior is to scan new images upon build, allowing you to view past results in the scan history tab.\n   - To enable built-in vulnerability scanning, go to the **DevOps** section in the Choreo Console, navigate to the **Scanners** pane, and then to the **Trivy** card.\n\n2. **Trivy CI Secrets**:\n   - Alternatively, you can enable vulnerability scans through Trivy CI secrets.\n   - In this case, Trivy automatically triggers scans for every commit.\n   - This requires generating a secret at your Git provider and copying the generated token, which must be stored securely (e.g., in GitHub Actions).\n   - You need to include this token in your Dockerfile or CI pipeline script for the scan to run during each deployment.\n\n   ![Trigger image scan with trivy](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/references/image-scan-with-trivy.png)\n\n### Building a Container Image\nBefore running the scan, ensure you have built the container image associated with your component. You can do this from the **Component Listing** pane, select your component, click **Build**, and complete the build process.\n\nFor more detailed instructions on building a container image, see the [Build a Container Image](./build-a-container-image.md) document.\n\n### Running a Trivy Scan\nOnce you have enabled vulnerability scanning, running a scan varies depending on your setup:\n\n#### For Built-in Scans:\n1. Navigate to the **Scan History** page in the DevOps section of your component.\n2. Click on **Run Scan** and choose your desired scan type.\n\n![Trivy scan icon](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/references/trivy-icon.png)\n\n![Trivy scan icon](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/references/trivy-run.png)\n\n#### For Trivy CI Secrets:\nYou run the Trivy scan automatically when a new commit is pushed, so it typically does not require manual triggering.\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of vulnerability scanning configurations, including enabling secrets and managing access keys, visit the following documentation:\n- [Enable Security Context Secret Mount](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-secrets-and-security-context/#step-3-enable-security-context-secret-mount)\n- [Create a Container Registry Secret](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-secrets-and-security-context/#step-4-create-a-container-registry-secret)\n\nIf your issue persists, consider checking the following:\n- Ensure that your Git repository URL is configured correctly in the Choreo console.\n- Verify that your component is deployed and ready for scanning.\n\nIf you need further assistance, feel free to ask!",

         "I have secret keys as configs for my react web app. How to manage them securely?",
         "To securely manage your secrets and configuration files like secret keys for a React web application in Choreo, you can follow these best practices:\n\n1. **Use Configurations:**\n   - Instead of storing sensitive information directly in your source code, use the built-in configurations feature provided by Choreo. This allows you to manage sensitive data separately from your application logic.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Set environment variables as configurations, which will enable security through encryption during transmission. Environment variables are particularly useful when you need to expose configuration and secret values to components within your project while keeping them confidential.\n\n3. **Secrets:**\n   - Use secrets for data that should not be exposed, such as database passwords or API keys. Secrets are not encrypted on their own, but you can set a token to decrypt them, making them available via environment variables. Note that this means that secrets are only secure if they are not copied into buildpack secrets caches or committed to Git repositories.\n\n4. **Manage Secrets and Configurations:**\n   - To create a configuration or secret, go to the **Component Listing** pane, select your component, and then navigate to the appropriate environments to add configurations or secrets.\n\n5. **Use a Secret Store (if necessary):**\n   - If you have secrets that require management beyond simple configurations and secrets, you can utilize the integrated Secret Store. This feature allows you to define a secret as per its intended usage type and provides options to view, edit, or delete it later if needed.\n\nHere’s a brief overview of the process for adding configurations or secrets:\n\n- **For Configurations**: \n  1. In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then **Configs & Secrets**.\n  2. Click on **+ Create**.\n  3. Define your configuration or secret and follow the prompts to save it.\n\n- **For Secrets**: \n  1. In the left navigation menu, click on **Security** and then **Secrets**.\n  2. Click on **+ Add**.\n  3. Define your secret details and store it.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your secret keys and configurations remain secure and managed effectively within Choreo.\n\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to the official documentation: [Secure Storage Options](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#secure-storage-options).",
         "To add configurations to a React web application in Choreo, follow these steps: Step 1: Create Configuration File . Create config.js File: Navigate to the public directory of your React application. Create and commit a new file named config.js in the public directory. This file should contain the runtime configuration variables you want to expose to your application. For example: window.config = { apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com', featureFlags: { enableNewFeature: true, enableExperimentalFeature: false, }, }; Step 2: Update index.html Include config.js in index.html: In the public directory, open the index.html file. Add a script tag to include the config.js file within the <body> tag: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang='en'> <head> <meta charset='utf-8' /> <title>My React App</title> </head> <body> <div id='root'></div> <script src='%PUBLIC_URL%/config.js'></script> </body> </html> Step 3: Access Configuration in React Component Access Configuration Variables: In your React components, you can access the configuration variables by referencing the window.config object. For example: import React from 'react'; function MyComponent() { const apiUrl = window.config.apiUrl; const enableNewFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableNewFeature; const enableExperimentalFeature = window.config.featureFlags.enableExperimentalFeature; // Your component logic here return ( <div> {/* Your component JSX here */} </div> ); } export default MyComponent; Step 4: Deploy the Application Deploy the Application: When deploying your React application to Choreo, ensure that the config.js file is correctly mounted in the specified path for each environment where your index.html expects it. You can create a config file mount via the Configurations pane on the Deploy page in the Choreo Console.",

         "What steps can I take to protect my web app?",
         "To secure your web application effectively within the Choreo environment, follow these recommended steps:\n\n1. **Implement Authentication**: Use the built-in identity provider (IdP) in Choreo for managing user authentication. This includes setting up user management, groups, and roles, which will facilitate secure access control.\n   \n2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: To add an extra layer of security to your web app, enable two-factor authentication for user accounts. This helps prevent unauthorized access by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.\n\n3. **Secure Web Applications**:\n   - Use the provided web application component types to create your application and configure the necessary security settings during deployment.\n   - Ensure that any API invoked through your web application has proper security measures in place, such as rate limiting, throttling, and JWT validations to safeguard against API abuse and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Use Service Chain for Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Implement a service chain with your external identity provider for integrating with Choreo. This allows you to manage user sessions across different applications seamlessly.\n\n5. **Observe Application Security**: Monitor application-level logs and alerts to detect and mitigate any security threats. This can include identifying unusual activity that may indicate a breach or unauthorized access attempt.\n\nFor more detailed information on implementing security measures within Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Protect Your Web App with Managed Identity](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-idp/#step-1-configure-the-built-in-idp-for-your-choreo-account)\n- [Manage Applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#configure-built-in-idp-for-self-sign-up-and-manage-users-in-your-organization)\n- [Develop a Secure Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/develop-a-secure-web-application/)",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component. Using this method you can secure your web application.",

         "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?",
         "To protect an API in Choreo, you can utilize various methods depending on your requirements, primarily through two approaches: OAuth 2.0 Authentication and Asgardeo. Here’s how each works:\n\n### 1. Using Choreo's Built-In Authentication Functionality\nChoreo provides a built-in method for securing APIs that uses the `x-api-key` header. This method grants restricted APIs to authorized keys rather than implementing OAuth. The steps include:\n\n1. **Create an API Proxy**: Deploy the API proxy and define the API path under **Set Up** > **Endpoint Mapping**.\n   \n2. **Enable Security Context**: Go to **Develop** > **Deploy**, where you can enable security context.\n\n3. **Set Up the API Key**: In the **API Info** tab under **Basic Details**, set the **Key Name** and click **Generate** to create the API key.\n\n4. **Deploy the API**: Click **Deploy** to register the API with Choreo.\n\nThis approach allows for secure access without integrating additional tools like Asgardeo.\n\n### 2. Using OAuth 2.0 Authentication\nOAuth 2.0 is another effective method to protect your APIs. It involves creating an application in Choreo and assigning permissions to the API components you wish to secure. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Assign Permissions**: In the Choreo console, select the component you want to secure under **Deploy**.\n   - Click on **Endpoint Configurations**.\n   - In the **Permissions List**, enter a permission name and click **+Add New**.\n   - Assign the desired permissions to the relevant endpoints.\n\n2. **Manage API Key Settings**: After deploying the API, manage API key settings under **Manage** > **API Keys** to retrieve the necessary keys.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively protect your APIs in Choreo using either built-in security or OAuth 2.0.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the documentation on [securing an API with Choreo built-in security](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/) and [secure API access with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/#set-up-an-asgardeo-application).",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Below are the general steps for each approach: Securing API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: In the Component Listing pane, click on your API component. Navigate to Manage > Permissions. Click + Add Permission (Scope). Enter the permission value in the Permission List pane and click + Add New.

         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3.

    "\"To deploy a web application on the Choreo platform, follow these steps:\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n1. Ensure you have the required permissions for your organization. Typically, the minimum required permissions are: **Organization Read**, **Project Read**, and **Project Write**.\\n\\n### Steps to Deploy a Web Application in Choreo\\n1. **Create a Web Application Component**: If you already have an application connected to your Git repository, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, connect your GitHub repository to Choreo by following the [Choreo Connect GitHub Repositories](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/connect-github-repos-choreo/#connect-github-repos-to-choreo) guide.\\n   \\n2. In the left navigation menu of the Choreo Console, click **Deploy**.\\n3. Select your component from the list of components to view the **Deploy** page.\\n4. In the **Set Up** card on the **Deploy** page, ensure you have filled in the mandatory fields such as a display name, name, version, project, label, description, and build pack.\\n5. Click on **Deploy** to start the deployment process. The build configuration will appear once the deployment completes successfully.\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n- Choreo automatically applies best practices like microservices architecture and follows a modular design principle.\\n- After the initial deployment, you can update the source code, apply new configurations, or rebuild your container image when changes are made in the source code repositories linked to the respective components.\\n\\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the official documentation here: [Deploy Your First Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/deploy-your-first-web-application/#step-3-deploy-the-web-application).\",\n",
    "\"The \\\"Module not found error\\\" typically occurs when your application cannot locate or access the necessary libraries or files that it needs to run properly. This issue can occur both at the time of deployment and while running the deployed application. Here are some strategies you can use to resolve this error:\\n\\n### Steps to Troubleshoot and Resolve Module Not Found Errors During Deployment:\\n\\n1. **Verify File Paths**: Ensure that all required files (such as configurations, scripts, etc.) are stored in the correct directory. Sometimes, relative paths may cause the module to be inaccessible.\\n\\n   Example: If your `main.py` is located in `/my/project/main.py`, make sure that any other files or directories are accessible through the same path.\\n\\n2. **Check Libraries**: Confirm that all dependencies are included correctly. Missing or incorrectly referenced third-party libraries can cause a `ModuleNotFoundError`.\\n\\n   - Make sure your Dockerfile contains commands to install any necessary dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` (if you're using a Python project). For example:\\n     ```bash\\ncp requirements.txt .\\npip install --upgrade pip\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\n3. **Dockerfile Structure**: If you are using a Dockerfile, ensure it follows best practices:\\n\\n   - Use an explicit `WORKDIR` to avoid potential confusion with environment variables.\\n   - Ensure the command section is clean and separates from the `COPY` section for better readability and maintainability.\\n   \\n   ```Dockerfile\\nFROM python:3.7\\nRUN cp requirements.txt .\\nRUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt\\nCOPY . /app\\nWORKDIR /app\\nENTRYPOINT [\\\"python\\\", \\\"main.py\\\"]\\n# Add other commands here if needed\\n``` \\n\\n4. **Container Image Build Failure**: If there are issues during container image build, the command will return with a non-zero exit status, leading to a `ModuleNotFoundError`. To troubleshoot:\\n\\n   - Clean the cache before building (`docker build -f <path-to-Dockerfile> -t <image-name>:<tag> -ci .`).\\n   - Check if there are any permission errors or file corruption during the build process.\\n\\n5. **CI/CD Process**: Ensure your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment processes are configured correctly:\\n\\n   - Check if your component has set up a proper build pack. The build pack handles compiling your code, packaging it into a container image, and pushing it to your preferred cloud environment.\\n   - Verify that all environment variables are properly defined and assigned to their respective components.\\n\\n6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Use logging and monitoring tools within your Choreo Console to track any deployment failures and monitor application logs for clues.\\n\\n### Common Error Messages:\\n- **No module named 'some_module'**: This indicates that `some_module.py` cannot be found.\\n- **Error reading the manifest file**: This may occur if there are missing or incorrectly formatted dependencies.\\n\\nFor more detailed troubleshooting, you can refer to the following links in the Choreo documentation:\\n- [Builds & Deployments](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/choreo-concepts/ci-cd/#build-and-deploy)\\n- [Build a Container Image From Scratch](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/create-container-image-from-scratch/)\",\n",
    "\"To enhance the security and privacy of your service interactions in Choreo, incorporating authentication mechanisms is essential. Here’s how to configure basic security for REST services, which can then be extended to service-to-service and service-to-user communication.\\n\\n### Adding Basic Security to a Service\\n\\n1. **Select Your Component**: In the Choreo Console, locate the component you wish to secure. If you need to generate new credentials, navigate to **Deploy** > **Endpoint Configurations** under the **Set Up** card.\\n\\n2. **Define Endpoints**: Identify the endpoints that require protection from unauthorized access. Ensure these endpoints include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or TRACE operations, as they may be exposed via standard API proxies.\\n\\n3. **Configure Endpoint Scopes**: Specify scopes for each endpoint. These are identifiers that describe permissions attached to a resource. This is crucial because you will later apply roles to these scopes during role-based access control. Note that scopes must be defined explicitly, similar to setting tags for a cloud-native database connection. Use appropriate names for scopes to define permissions effectively.\\n\\n4. **Set Authentication Level**: In the **Deploy** section, select **Basic Security with OAuth** as the authentication level. Configure the necessary options for this method, including selecting your identity provider.\\n\\n5. **Protect the Endpoint**: To test your secured endpoint, go back to the **Develop** section, click on **Test**, set up test users, and initiate a test request. Upon successful deployment, the Invoke page will display details about the deployed endpoint.\\n\\n### Extending Authentication\\n\\nOnce basic authentication is configured, it’s advisable to upgrade your component to an OAuth application if you plan on implementing a full OAuth2.0 flow. This allows you to manage user tokens effectively and handle API subscriptions more rigorously.\\n\\nFor detailed guidance on configuring an Identity Provider for your service, please refer to the [Choreo documentation on adding basic authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/configure-basic-authentication-for-a-component/#step-3-set-up-the-identity-provider-for-your-component).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can secure your service with appropriate measures ensuring safe interaction and enhanced protection against unauthorized access.\",\n",
    "\"To add a custom domain for your web application in Choreo, follow these steps:\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n1. **Admin Privileges**: Ensure you have admin privileges in your organization.\\n2. **Custom Domain Ready to Use**: You should have already created a domain for your web application in the Choreo Developer Portal.\\n\\n### Steps to Add a Custom Domain\\n\\n1. In the Choreo Console, go to the top navigation menu and click on **Organization**. Then select your organization from the list.\\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**.\\n3. On the Organization Settings page, click on the **URL Settings** tab and then the **Active Domains** tab.\\n4. Click on **+ Add Domains**.\\n5. In the **Add a Custom Domain** pane, specify your desired domain name, select the environment, and choose the entity type (API, Web App, etc.) and the component.\\n6. After that, generate the requisite SSL certificates and add them to the DNS provider. Once done, verify the CNAME record during the next step.\\n7. Copy the custom URL template generated by Choreo and paste it into your DNS settings. This will allow you to create a DNS record for your domain.\\n8. Upon successful verification of the CNAME mapping, a custom URL will be provisioned for your application in the Developer Portal and your component in the Choreo console.\\n9. Finally, redirect your user traffic via the generated custom URL.\\n\\nFor detailed steps and additional options related to the TLS certificate, refer to the [Choreo documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/administer/configure-a-custom-domain-for-your-organization/#add-a-custom-domain-for-an-organization).\",\n",

Note that this means that secrets are only secure if they are not copied into buildpack secrets caches or committed to Git repositories.\\n\\n4. **Manage Secrets and Configurations:**\\n   - To create a configuration or secret, go to the **Component Listing** pane, select your component, and then navigate to the appropriate environments to add configurations or secrets.\\n\\n5. **Use a Secret Store (if necessary):**\\n   - If you have secrets that require management beyond simple configurations and secrets, you can utilize the integrated Secret Store. This feature allows you to define a secret as per its intended usage type and provides options to view, edit, or delete it later if needed.\\n\\nHere’s a brief overview of the process for adding configurations or secrets:\\n\\n- **For Configurations**: \\n  1. In the left navigation menu, click on **DevOps** and then **Configs & Secrets**.\\n  2. Click on **+ Create**.\\n  3. Define your configuration or secret and follow the prompts to save it.\\n\\n- **For Secrets**: \\n  1. In the left navigation menu, click on **Security** and then **Secrets**.\\n  2. Click on **+ Add**.\\n  3. Define your secret details and store it.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your secret keys and configurations remain secure and managed effectively within Choreo.\\n\\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to the official documentation: [Secure Storage Options](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#secure-storage-options).\",\n",
    "\"To secure your web application effectively within the Choreo environment, follow these recommended steps:\\n\\n1. **Implement Authentication**: Use the built-in identity provider (IdP) in Choreo for managing user authentication. This includes setting up user management, groups, and roles, which will facilitate secure access control.\\n   \\n2. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: To add an extra layer of security to your web app, enable two-factor authentication for user accounts. This helps prevent unauthorized access by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.\\n\\n3. **Secure Web Applications**:\\n   - Use the provided web application component types to create your application and configure the necessary security settings during deployment.\\n   - Ensure that any API invoked through your web application has proper security measures in place, such as rate limiting, throttling, and JWT validations to safeguard against API abuse and potential vulnerabilities.\\n\\n4. **Use Service Chain for Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Implement a service chain with your external identity provider for integrating with Choreo. This allows you to manage user sessions across different applications seamlessly.\\n\\n5. **Observe Application Security**: Monitor application-level logs and alerts to detect and mitigate any security threats. This can include identifying unusual activity that may indicate a breach or unauthorized access attempt.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on implementing security measures within Choreo, you can refer to the following documentation:\\n- [Protect Your Web App with Managed Identity](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-idp/#step-1-configure-the-built-in-idp-for-your-choreo-account)\\n- [Manage Applications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/consuming-services/manage-application/#configure-built-in-idp-for-self-sign-up-and-manage-users-in-your-organization)\\n- [Develop a Secure Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-web-applications/develop-a-secure-web-application/)\",\n",
    "\"To protect an API in Choreo, you can utilize various methods depending on your requirements, primarily through two approaches: OAuth 2.0 Authentication and Asgardeo. Here’s how each works:\\n\\n### 1. Using Choreo's Built-In Authentication Functionality\\nChoreo provides a built-in method for securing APIs that uses the `x-api-key` header. This method grants restricted APIs to authorized keys rather than implementing OAuth. The steps include:\\n\\n1. **Create an API Proxy**: Deploy the API proxy and define the API path under **Set Up** > **Endpoint Mapping**.\\n   \\n2. **Enable Security Context**: Go to **Develop** > **Deploy**, where you can enable security context.\\n\\n3. **Set Up the API Key**: In the **API Info** tab under **Basic Details**, set the **Key Name** and click **Generate** to create the API key.\\n\\n4. **Deploy the API**: Click **Deploy** to register the API with Choreo.\\n\\nThis approach allows for secure access without integrating additional tools like Asgardeo.\\n\\n### 2. Using OAuth 2.0 Authentication\\nOAuth 2.0 is another effective method to protect your APIs. It involves creating an application in Choreo and assigning permissions to the API components you wish to secure. Here are the steps:\\n\\n1. **Assign Permissions**: In the Choreo console, select the component you want to secure under **Deploy**.\\n   - Click on **Endpoint Configurations**.\\n   - In the **Permissions List**, enter a permission name and click **+Add New**.\\n   - Assign the desired permissions to the relevant endpoints.\\n\\n2. **Manage API Key Settings**: After deploying the API, manage API key settings under **Manage** > **API Keys** to retrieve the necessary keys.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively protect your APIs in Choreo using either built-in security or OAuth 2.0.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the documentation on [securing an API with Choreo built-in security](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-choreo-built-in-security-token-service/) and [secure API access with Asgardeo](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-asgardeo/#set-up-an-asgardeo-application).\",\n",

         "To connect your backend deployed in Choreo to your frontend application hosted on GitHub Pages, you need to follow a structured approach. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n### Steps to Connect Frontend and Backend\n\n1. **Ensure Your Frontend is Deployed**:\n   - Make sure that your frontend application is already deployed on GitHub Pages. This means it should be accessible via its URL.\n\n2. **Obtain the Backend URL**:\n   - After successfully deploying your backend in Choreo, note down the `Endpoint` URL provided during the deployment process. This will be the endpoint from which your frontend can communicate.\n\n3. **Update your Frontend Application**:\n   - In your frontend code, update any references to your backend services. Typically, this would involve hardcoding the backend URL if your frontend and backend are separate components (like in your case). \n   - For example, if you have hardcoded a relative URL, replace it with the absolute URL of the Choreo endpoint.\n\n4. **Set Up Environment Variables (if needed)**:\n   - If there is a need to pass sensitive data or configuration specific to the production environment, you can use environment variables in GitHub Actions to manage these securely. This helps maintain good practices regarding secrets management.\n\n5. **Implement CORS (if necessary)**:\n   - Ensure that your backend allows cross-origin requests from your frontend by configuring CORS settings. This might require updating the network configurations within Choreo.\n\n6. **Testing**:\n   - After making the necessary changes, perform testing to ensure that the frontend can successfully interact with the backend as expected.\n\n### Important Considerations\n- The connection between the two must be done post-deployment, so it's crucial to have both applications functional and ready before establishing communication.\n- If you face any network-related issues, check the permissions and any firewall settings both on Choreo and your GitHub Pages site.\n\n### Additional Resources\nFor more details on managing configurations and secrets, you can refer to the documentation on [Managing Configurations and Secrets](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#use-environment-variables-in-github-actions).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to connect your backend deployed in Choreo with your frontend application hosted on GitHub Pages effectively.",

For instance, `/healthz` or `/health` are common paths to query.\n   - **HTTP POST Request**: This option allows sending an `HTTP POST` request to a specified port and path, which is less commonly used for readiness checks.\n   - **Execute Command**: Running a script inside the container, like checking file permissions or CPU/RAM utilization, is also an option.\n\n6. **Set Conditions**: Define any conditions that must be met for the readiness probe to trigger.\n7. **Save Your Settings**: Once configured, click **Save** to apply the readiness probe.\n8. **Redeploy if Necessary**: If your component does not already have network visibility, go to the **Deploy** page and click **Update Image & Deploy** to ensure the probe is activated.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Readiness probes do not run at regular intervals like liveness probes but execute only once per deployment lifecycle unless manually triggered or the status of a resource changes.\n- These probes are essential for managing load balancing and ensuring smooth application operations, particularly in auto-scaling configurations.\n\nFor further details, you can refer to the [Configure Health Checks](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/configure-health-checks/) documentation.",
         "To configure a readiness probe in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the component for which you want to configure readiness probes.\n2. In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then click **Health Checks**.\n3. On the **Health Checks** page, click **+ Create**.\n4. Configure the readiness probe depending on your requirement.\n5. Click **Save**. \n\nYou can update or remove a probe at any time. After setting up the probe, you can ensure that the container works as expected by clicking **Runtime** under **DevOps** in the left navigation menu. On the **Runtime** page, check the details to confirm that the container works as expected. If the container does not start, check the **events and conditions** to see if any of the probes are causing the container to fail.\n\nReadiness probes run periodically throughout the lifecycle of a container. Unlike liveness probes, these probes do not restart the container if the probe fails. Instead, they stop the container from receiving network traffic. Be mindful when you configure readiness probes on a single-running replica. If the readiness probe fails, your application stops receiving traffic because there is only one active replica. The application may not recover unless the liveness probe fails and restarts the container.\n\nYou can configure the following probe types for readiness probes:\n\n- HTTP `GET` request: This probe sends an HTTP `GET` request to a specified port and path on the container. A response status code in the range of 200-399 indicates that the request is a success. Depending on your requirement, you can configure additional HTTP headers. The recommended approach is to create a `/healthz` or `/health` endpoint in your service for this purpose.\n- TCP connection probe: This probe attempts to open a socket to the container on the specified port. If it cannot establish a TCP connection, it becomes a failure.\n- Execute a command: This probe executes a given script inside the container. A non-zero return from the command is considered a failure. For example, `[\"\"cat\"\", \"\"/tmp/healthy\"\"]` is considered healthy if the file `/tmp/healthy` is present. If not, it becomes a failure (non-zero exit code). In such scenarios, the application is responsible for writing and maintaining this file in the specified location.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Set Up Health Checks] documentation.",

         "If you are encountering Trivy security check errors in Choreo, you can troubleshoot these issues by following several steps to identify and resolve potential problems.\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps\n\n1. **Check Component Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that your component's configuration correctly specifies the required ports, network types, and other parameters necessary for secure connections. This can vary based on the type of project you have (for instance, it differs between Service projects and Web Application projects).\n   - Verify that the project-level endpoints are configured properly to reflect how your services will interact with each other.\n   - Make sure to enable the **Health Check** and configure the health probe if needed, as failing health checks can cause errors during deployments.\n\n2. **Use Dependency Track UI for Security Vulnerabilities**:\n   - If your component has dependencies with known vulnerabilities, consider using the [Dependency Track UI](https://security.trivy.io/) to analyze your project's dependencies.\n   - Identify the libraries with security vulnerabilities and determine if they are being used incorrectly, such as passing sensitive data without proper encoding.\n   \n3. **Scan Configurations and Build Logs**:\n   - If you're facing \"build scan failed\" errors, check the **Build Logs** pane for specific error messages and ensure that the credentials or configurations used in the build process are correct.\n\n4. **Manage Network Visibility Settings**:\n   - Be aware that visibility settings (Public, Organization, or Project) for API components can impact connectivity. If there are network visibility mismatches, you may encounter errors related to unauthorized access or connection refused.\n\n5. **Review Build and Scan Pipelines**:\n   - It's crucial to validate your builds before running scans or pushing to production. If a scan detects security vulnerabilities, review the build pipeline to confirm it successfully completes.\n\nBy carefully reviewing these steps and ensuring that all configurations and network settings are appropriate for your application, you should be able to resolve the Trivy security check errors effectively.\n\nFor more detailed information on handling Trivy scan results and managing vulnerability notifications, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Configure and Manage Vulnerability Scanning](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/scan/dependency-scan/configure-and-manage-vulnerability-scanning/)\n- [Handle Vulnerability Notifications](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/monitoring-and-insights/alerts-and-notifications/manage-vulnerability-notifications/#handle-vulnerability-notifications)",

If critical vulnerabilities are found, the deployment process will halt. The Trivy scan status and any security failures are displayed in the deployment pane. Click on the Library (Trivy) vulnerable scan step to view the details of the vulnerabilities. Fix the Vulnerabilities: Fix the Identified Vulnerabilities: The best approach to resolving these errors is to address the identified vulnerabilities in your code or dependencies. Update or replace the vulnerable libraries with their secure versions. Ignore the Vulnerabilities (Temporarily): Create a .trivyignore File: If you cannot fix a critical CVE immediately, you can choose to ignore the vulnerability by creating a .trivyignore file. Add the .trivyignore file to your Docker build context path. For example, {buildContextPath}/.trivyignore. In the .trivyignore file, list the CVEs you want to ignore, one per line: CVE-2023-xxxx CVE-2023-yyyy CVE-2023-xxxx Redeploy the Component: Rebuild and Redeploy the Component: After fixing or ignoring the vulnerabilities: Rebuild your component by triggering a new build in the Builds pane.",

         "To configure a **.json** or **.yaml** configuration file for a web application deployed to Choreo, follow these guidelines and steps:\n\n### Configuration File Support\nChoreo supports configuration files in either JSON or YAML format, with a file extension that matches the content type. The configuration files should be stored in Git. These files allow you to manage variable configurations that can vary across different environments like development, staging, and production.\n\n### Best Practices\n1. **Keep sensitive data secure**: Use configuration files instead of environment variables for sensitive information like passwords, access tokens, and keys.\n2. **Environment-specific values**: Override default values defined in your configuration file by defining environment-specific variables during deployment.\n3. **Version control**: Ensure that your configuration files are committed to your repository but exclude sensitive information from being published.\n\n### Excluding Files from Version Control\nIf your project contains sensitive information like database credentials or OAuth tokens in the configuration files, you can exclude them from version control by using the following approaches:\n\n#### `.gitignore` File\n1. Create a `.gitignore` file in your root directory if you don't have one already.\n2. Add the paths to the configuration files you want to exclude, for example:\n   ```\n   config/credentials.yaml\n   config/secrets.json\n   ```\n3. Commit the `.gitignore` file and the configuration files to ensure they are excluded from being committed to the repository.\n\n#### `github-secrets` GitHub Action (recommended)\nFor added security, you can utilize the `github-secrets` GitHub Action to manage secrets efficiently:\n1. Go to the **Settings** of your GitHub repository and click on **Secrets**.\n2. Create a new secret with a name that reflects its purpose.\n3. Paste the content of your configuration file into the **Raw Secret** editor window.\n4. Click **Add Secret**.\n\n### Example Configuration File\nHere's a sample configuration file to give you an idea:\n```yaml\nserver:\n  host: \"0.0.0.0\"\n  port: 8090\nendpoints:\n  - name: Endpoint 1\n    host: \"endpoint1-host\"\n    port: 8080\n  - name: Endpoint 2\n    host: \"endpoint2-host\"\n    port: 8070\n```\n\nBy adhering to these best practices and guidelines, you can effectively manage configuration files for your web application within Choreo.\n\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [Manage Configurations and Secrets documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/manage-configurations-and-secrets/#best-practices).",

Here’s how to enable it:\n\n1. **Access Component:** In the **Component Listing** pane, click on the web application you want to configure.\n2. **Manage Settings:** Go to the **Settings** option in the left navigation menu.\n3. **Authentication Keys Tab:** Navigate to the **Authentication Keys** tab.\n4. **Choose Identity Provider:** Select **Choreo Built-in Identity Provider** as the identity provider and specify the appropriate audiences.\n5. **Configure:** Click **Configure** to generate client keys and copy the discovery URL.\n6. **Enable Secure Web App:** Turn on the **Secure Web Application** toggle and paste the discovery URL you copied earlier.\n7. **Save Changes:** Finally, click **Apply**.\n\nThis configuration ensures that your web application securely handles user authentication using industry-standard protocols.\n\nFor detailed steps, check [Configure Managed Authentication for a Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-1-set-up-managed-authentication-for-the-web-application).\n\n### 2. Enable External Authentication with a Third-Party Identity Provider (IdP)\nYou can also integrate an external identity provider to manage user authentication. Follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Select Your Organization:** From the **Project Listing** pane, select your project.\n2. **Navigate to Component:** In the left navigation menu, click on **Settings** and then select the **Authentication Keys** tab.\n3. **Add IdP Credentials:** Under the **Identity Providers** section, add your chosen IdP’s credentials and follow the respective guidelines for the IdP you are using (e.g., Azure Active Directory, Asgardeo, etc.).\n\nEnsure to select the appropriate audiences and set the `code` as the grant type. After this setup, Choreo will redirect users to your configured IdP for authentication, and upon successful sign-in, it will callback with the tokens needed for authorization.\n\nFor more details, visit [Configure Third-Party Authentication for the Web Application](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-2-enable-external-authentication-for-the-web-application).\n\n### 3. Leverage Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\nYou can assign roles to users via your external IdP or through Choreo’s built-in Identity Provider. Ensure that the roles assigned correspond to the necessary permissions for the services users will access.\n\nFor further information on configuring role-based access control, see the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/#step-3-set-up-role-based-access-control-for-your-web-application).\n\nBy following these steps, you can enhance the security of your web application within the Choreo ecosystem effectively.\n\nFor comprehensive guides, refer to the full documentation at: [Secure Web Applications with Managed Authentication](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-web-applications-with-managed-authentication/).",
         "To secure your web application in Choreo, you can utilize Choreo's managed authentication feature. Here’s how you can set it up: Step 1: Implement Managed Authentication 1.1 Implement the Sign-in Functionality Add a sign-in button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/login path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={() => { window.location.href='/auth/login' }}>Login</button> When the user clicks this button, Choreo will handle the authentication process with the configured identity provider. 1.2 Obtain User Information Claims You can get user information after a successful sign-in through a userinfo cookie or a GET endpoint. Using userinfo cookie: import Cookies from 'js-cookie'; // Read userinfo cookie value. const encodedUserInfo = Cookies.get('userinfo'); // Decode the value. const userInfo = JSON.parse(atob(encodedUserInfo)); // Clear the cookie. Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs.

         "To set up alerts for your service in Choreo, you can configure either latency alerts or traffic alerts. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do both: Setting Up Traffic Alerts Traffic alerts notify you when the request count of an API exceeds a predefined threshold. This is useful for managing APIs with backend traffic limits or monetized backends that require proactive scaling based on incoming traffic. Ensure you are in the correct organization where you have a project with the API to configure a traffic alert. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click Usage Insights. In the left navigation menu on the Usage Insights page, click Alerts. Click the Environment list and select the required environment. Click Alert Configuration. This opens the Alert Configuration pane. Click the Traffic tab. In the API Name field, select the API for which you want to configure the alert. Only the APIs that you have invoked at least once are listed here. For other APIs, you need to give the API name in the required format as instructed in the UI. In the Metric field, select the required metric against which you want to evaluate the alert configuration. In the Threshold field, specify the threshold number of requests per minute. If required, specify the list of emails that should be notified when the alert is generated in the Emails field. Click Add. Once an alert is successfully added, the alert configuration is listed in the Alert Configuration pane. Each configuration can be edited and removed via this pane. Setting Up Latency Alerts Latency alerts notify you if the response latency of an API exceeds a predefined threshold. This is useful for APIs that need to meet specific SLAs and for proactively identifying slow APIs. Ensure you are in the correct organization where you have a project with the API to configure a latency alert. In the Choreo Console left navigation menu, click Usage Insights. In the left navigation menu on the Usage Insights page, click Alerts. Click the Environment list and select the required environment. Click Alert Configuration. This opens the Alert Configuration pane with the Latency tab open by default. In the API Name field, select the API for which you want to configure the alert.

         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)\nHorizontal pod autoscaler automatically scales the replicas of a component based on resource consumption metrics like CPU and memory thresholds. This allows your application to handle varying loads dynamically.\n\n**Steps to configure HPA:**\n- In the **Component Listing** pane, select the component you want to scale.\n- Navigate to the **DevOps** section and click on **Autoscale**.\n- Click on **Configure** next to **Horizontal Scaling** to set up the HPA.\n  \n  ![Configure HPA](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/configure-approach-02.png)\n\n#### Setting Min & Max Replicas:\n| Container Running Status | Meaning                                                        |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Minimum Replicas        | Ensures there is at least one replica available. <br> If CPU/memory threshold is not crossed, it will be increased up to this limit.<br> Set to `1` for production use cases.<br>(Default: `1`).<br>|<br> |Maximum Replicas    | Prevents the replicas from exceeding this number, even if CPU/memory threshold is crossed. <br> The value is used after reaching the minimum. <br>(Default: `5`).<br>| <br>\n\n### 2. Configure Dynamic Provisions Storage Class\nFor components that require a persistent volume (like databases), Choreo uses **Dynamic Provisioning** to automatically create storage volumes when the required space exceeds the allocated limit.\n\n**Steps to enable Dynamic Provisioning for storage:**\n- In the **DevOps** section, go to **Storage**.\n- Create a storage class and ensure the **Dynamic Provisioning** checkbox is selected. Specify a **Storage Capacity Limit**.\n\n  ![Create Storage](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/assets/img/devops-and-ci-cd/storage/create-storage-class.png)\n\n#### Storage Classes and Priorities:\nWhen requesting storage, lower-priority classes can automatically upgrade to a higher class if space reaches the allocated limit.\n\n### Additional Information\n- If a request is made to a lower priority storage class, it will not affect other critical services running in the same namespace.\n- Ensure that your deployment does not run out of storage abruptly by setting appropriate capacity limits.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, ensuring efficient resource management.\n\nFor more detailed information, refer to the documentation here: [Auto-scaling components with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/aut-scale-with-hpa/#auto-scale-components-with-horizontal-pod-autoscaler).",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "To limit requests coming to your API in Choreo, you have two primary methods: utilizing rate limiting at the API level or applying a blackout time at the API key level.\n\n### 1. **Rate Limiting at the API Level**\nYou can apply different rate limit plans when you deploy your API. This is essential for preventing API overload and ensuring smooth performance for users. Here’s how to do it:\n\n- Navigate to the **Deploy** section.\n- On the **Set Up** card, click **Rate Limiting** to expand the settings.\n- Select a rate limit plan that suits your requirements from the available options and apply it to your API.\n\nThis will help manage the load and prevent any single user from consuming too much of the API's resources.\n\n### 2. **Blackout Time at the API Key Level**\nIf you want to further control the usage of your API by limiting the amount of time that the API key is active, you can set a blackout period. This is useful if you observe high traffic during specific times or need to manage sudden spikes in usage.\n\n- In the left navigation menu, click **Settings**.\n- Go to the **API Configuration** tab and then to the **Developer Portal** tab.\n- Here, you can edit the API key details and set the appropriate blackout time as per your needs.\n\nThis feature ensures that if too many requests are made within a short time frame, it helps to mitigate any potential overload.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the following documents:\n- [Limit Requests Coming to My API - Rate Limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/#limit-requests-coming-to-my-api)\n- [Limit Requests Coming to My API - Black Out Time](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/#limit-requests-coming-to-my-api--blackout-time)\n\nThese steps should help you effectively manage the request load on your API.",

         "To manage traffic coming to your API in Choreo, you can implement both rate limiting and throttling mechanisms depending on your needs.\n\n### Rate Limiting\nRate limiting helps protect your backend from being overwhelmed by requests and can also serve as a protective measure against malicious attacks. When rate limiting is enabled, every API invocation consumes units of quota defined in the subscription plan. Once the specified quota is exceeded, the request will return an `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests` status.\n\nHere’s how you can enable **API rate-limiting** during deployment:\n\n1. Go to the left navigation menu, click **Deploy**.\n2. In the **Set Up** card, click **API Configuration**.\n3. Select the **Rate Limiting** tab, choose **Request Limiting**, and specify:\n   - **Limit Type**: Select `Bucket`.\n   - **Duration**: Choose a time unit (like minute, hour, day).\n   - **Requests**: Enter the number of requests.\n4. Click **Apply** to save your changes.\n5. Build and deploy the component again.\n6. Publish the API.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the documentation here: [Control Traffic with Rate Limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/control-traffic-with-rate-limiting/#enable-api-rate-limiting-during-deployment).\n\n### Throttling\nThrottling allows you to manage the load on your API by controlling the rate at which client applications can submit requests. It helps prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and ensures fair usage.\n\nYou can set up API throttling through subscription plans:\n\n1. When creating or updating a subscription plan, go to the desired plan's **Create Subscription Plan** page.\n2. Under the **Developer Portal** section, select a minimum and maximum limit under **Throttle Levels**.\n\nFor further details on managing throttling, you can check this documentation: [Control Traffic with API Throttling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/control-traffic-with-api-throttling/).\n\nIn summary, you can effectively control the traffic coming to your API by leveraging rate limiting to manage request quotas and throttling to monitor and restrict API usage, thereby ensuring optimal performance and security.",

Cookies.remove('userinfo', { path: '/' }); Using GET endpoint: const response = await fetch('/auth/userinfo'); 1.3 Implement the Sign-out Functionality Add a sign-out button to your web application which redirects users to the /auth/logout path. Here's a sample code snippet: <button onClick={async () => { window.location.href = `/auth/logout?session_hint=${Cookies.get('session_hint')}`; }}>Logout</button> Choreo will clear the session cookies and handle the sign-out process. 1.4 Invoke APIs To invoke Choreo APIs, use the relative path /choreo-apis/<api-suffix>. For example: const response = await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); If managed authentication is enabled, you don’t need to manually attach an access token to the API call. 1.5 Handle Session Expiry To handle session expiry, you can encapsulate the request with re-login logic: export const performGet = async (url) => { try { return await fetch('/choreo-apis/<api-suffix>'); } catch (error) { if (error instanceof HttpError && error.status === 401) { window.location.href = '/auth/login'; } else { throw error; } } }; 1.6 Set Up a Custom Error Page Choreo allows you to set up a custom error page for redirection during errors. Configure the error path in your managed authentication settings. Step 2: Enable Managed Authentication and Configure Paths Go to your web application component in the Choreo Console. Click on Deploy. Click Configure & Deploy on the Set Up card. Ensure the Managed Authentication with Choreo toggle is enabled. Configure the following fields: Field Description Default Value Post Login Path Path to redirect after successful sign-in. / Post Logout Path Path to redirect after successful sign-out. / Error Path Path to redirect when an error occurs. Built-in error page Session Expiry Time Time in minutes after which the session expires. 10080 Minutes (7 Days) Additional Scopes Additional scopes required by the web application. none After configuring these settings, deploy the component. Using this method you can secure your web application.",

         "What methods can I use to protect an API in Choreo?",
         "There are several methods and best practices you can utilize to secure APIs in Choreo. Here’s a comprehensive overview:\n\n### 1. API Security Levels\nChoreo provides varying security levels for APIs:\n- **Public**: Open to anyone who requests it.\n- **Internal**: Accessible only within the organization's data plane.\n- **Private**: Only accessible via an API key or shared secret within the same application.\n\n### 2. Protecting APIs with Roles and Access Control\nYou can implement roles and access control to manage user permissions effectively:\n\n#### A. Implement Role-Based Access Control\n1. Define roles in your identity provider (IdP) with appropriate permissions.\n2. Configure Choreo components to use these roles:\n   - Navigate to the **Project** page.\n   - Click on the component to configure access.\n   - Specify application groups and select roles from the IdP.\n3. Assign users to application groups in the IdP.\n4. Manage role assignments through the Choreo Console.\n\nFor more detailed steps, you can refer to [Configure Role-Based Access Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-role-based-authorization/).\n\n### 3. Secure API Invocation Using an Application\n1. Create an application in Choreo:\n   - Click **+ Create** under Applications in the Developer Portal.\n   - Fill in the details and set the application level permissions.\n\n2. Configure API Access:\n   - Go to **Settings** of your API.\n   - Navigate to the **Subscription Key Generation** tab.\n   - Generate an API subscription.\n\n### 4. Implement OAuth 2.0 for API Security\nUsing OAuth 2.0 is a robust way to secure APIs:\n- Ensure your application supports authorization codes with PKCE.\n- Use a JWT audience claim for endpoint-specific access.\n- Implement a refresh token to automatically renew API keys if necessary.\n\nFor further details on securing APIs with OAuth 2.0, check out the [Secure API Access With OAuth 2.0 documentation](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-oauth2/).\n\n### Additional Recommendations\n- Regularly update authentication libraries to prevent vulnerabilities.\n- Employ secure coding practices to minimize risks.\n- Monitor API usage and response times to identify any anomalies.\n\nBy implementing these methods, you can significantly enhance the security of your APIs in Choreo. For further information, please refer to the following documentation links:\n- [Secure API Access With OAuth 2.0](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-oauth2/#generate-an-access-token-via-the-authentication-flow)\n- [Protect APIs With Role-Based Access Control](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/authentication-and-authorization/secure-api-access-with-role-based-authorization/)",
         "To secure an API in Choreo, you can leverage various methods such as integrating with external Identity Providers (IdPs) like Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or Asgardeo, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Below are the general steps for each approach: Securing API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: In the Component Listing pane, click on your API component. Navigate to Manage > Permissions. Click + Add Permission (Scope). Enter the permission value in the Permission List pane and click + Add New. Copy the fully qualified name of the scope for future reference. Attach the scope to a resource by selecting it from the Select Permissions list under the respective resource. Click Save and Deploy. Navigate to Manage > Lifecycle. Click Publish to publish your API to the Choreo Developer Portal. Create an API and Application in Azure AD: Follow Azure AD documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Azure AD API. Enable External IdP Authentication in Choreo: Create an application in Choreo and configure it to use Azure AD as an external IdP. Invoke the API with Scopes: Use the assigned scopes to authenticate and authorize API invocations. For detailed steps, refer to the Secure API Access with Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) documentation. Securing API Access with Asgardeo Assign Scopes to an API in Choreo: Similar to the Azure AD steps, assign scopes to your API in Choreo by navigating to Manage > Permissions and following the same steps to add permissions. Create an API and Application in Asgardeo: Follow Asgardeo documentation to create an API and register an application. Configure the application to consume the Asgardeo API.

         "To enable automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Navigate to Your Component**: In the left navigation menu, click on the component for which you want to manage scaling.\n  \n2. **Access DevOps Settings**: In the left navigation menu, click **DevOps** and then select **Scaling**.\n\n3. **Enable Scaling**: Turn on the **scale-to-zero** toggle. This setting allows your application to automatically scale down to zero replicas when there is no traffic, while ensuring it scales up to handle incoming requests when needed.\n\n4. **Set Minimum and Maximum Replicas**: Adjust the **Minimum replicas** slider to define the least number of active replicas you want to maintain. Set the **Maximum replicas** slider to indicate the maximum number of replicas your application should have, which will depend on your infrastructure setup.\n\n5. **Manage Scale-to-Zero Settings**: Expand the **Scale-to-Zero** section to access additional settings:\n   - **Requests on the Health Endpoint**: Set a request size limit (in bytes) for the health check endpoint. If the response exceeds this limit, the endpoint is considered unhealthy.\n   - **Health Check Types**: Choose between different health checks:\n     - **Port TCP Probe**: Establishes a TCP connection on a specified port; a failed attempt indicates a health issue.\n     - **HTTP GET Request**: Sends an HTTP GET request to the configured `health endpoint`. A status code outside the range of 200-399 is considered a failure.\n     - **HTTP GET Heartbeat Probe**: Similar to the HTTP GET request but periodically sends heartbeat messages instead of checking the status code.\n     - **Execute a Command**: Runs a shell command; a non-zero return value indicates an error. Note that these commands run inside a non-root `Linux` container.\n\n6. **Apply Changes**: Click **Update** to save your changes.\n\nThis process enables your application to scale dynamically, reducing costs during low demand and ensuring availability during peak usage.\n\nFor more detailed guidance, you can refer to the documentation [here](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/autoscale-components-with-scaling-to-zero/#set-up-autoscaling-for-your-container).",
         "To set up automatic scaling for your applications in Choreo, you have two main options: scaling component replicas and scale-to-zero. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to configure each: Autoscale Component Replicas Choreo allows you to automatically scale your component replicas up or down based on resource consumption. This ensures high availability and efficient resource usage. Note that autoscaling capabilities are only available in paid plans and private data plane organizations. Steps to Configure Autoscale Component Replicas: 1. Navigate to DevOps: In the Choreo Console, go to the DevOps section for your deployed component. 2. Set Scaling Parameters: Min Replicas: Set the minimum number of replicas (recommended minimum is 2). Max Replicas: Set the maximum number of replicas (up to 5 on the cloud data plane, no limit on private data planes). CPU Threshold: Set the average CPU utilization threshold to trigger scaling. Memory Threshold: Set the average memory usage threshold for scaling. 3. Save Configuration: Save the settings. Note that changes may take some time to apply. Scale-to-Zero Choreo also supports the scale-to-zero feature, which allows applications to scale down to zero replicas during inactivity. This is enabled by default for components created after February 23, 2024. How to Enable Scale-to-Zero: 1. Select Component: In the Component Listing pane, click the component you want to scale to zero. 2. Access Scaling Settings: In the left navigation menu, go to DevOps > Scaling. 3. Enable Scale-to-Zero: Click the scale-to-zero card to enable the feature. How Scale-to-Zero Works: Idle Timeout: The application scales down to zero after being idle for ~5 minutes. Request Handling: Scales up when an HTTP request is received. Pending Requests: Adds replicas if pending requests exceed a threshold. Considerations: Services with at least one endpoint with network visibility set to Project won't automatically scale to zero. HTTP services running on non-standard ports (e.g., 5000, 6000) won't scale to zero automatically.",

         "My service gets overloaded with requests how to fix this?",
         "If your service is getting overloaded with requests in Choreo, there are several strategies you can employ to manage or prevent further issues:\n\n1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: This is a common technique to control the rate at which clients can access your service. By setting rate limits, you can protect your backend from receiving more requests than it can handle.\n   \n2. **Request Queuing**: If rate limiting isn’t sufficient, request queuing allows incoming requests to queue when the server reaches its maximum connection limit, thereby ensuring requests don’t get lost.\n\n3. **Horizontal Scaling**: Increasing the number of replicas of your service can help distribute the load more efficiently across multiple instances. This method is particularly effective when demand spikes suddenly.\n\n4. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automate the scaling of replicas based on resource consumption and traffic. This ensures that your service can scale up automatically during periods of high activity, thus managing the load better.\n\n5. **API Throttling**: If necessary, you can apply throttling levels to limit API usage, especially if it’s causing performance issues.\n\n6. **Check Logs**: Monitor the logs to identify patterns and understand the nature of the overload. This may provide insights into what triggers the overload and guide your mitigation efforts.\n\n7. **Communication**: Keep your users informed about any capacity limitations through appropriate error messages or notifications.\n\nBy considering these methods, you can effectively manage your service's response to high traffic and ensure it operates optimally.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the following documentation:\n- [Manage API rate limiting](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/api-management/api-rate-limiting/)\n- [Set Up Dynamic Scaling](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/devops-and-ci-cd/autoscale/set-up-dynamic-scaling-for-your-container/#configure-autoscaling-for-container-components)",
         "Implementing rate limiting on APIs in Choreo involves the following steps: Access your component from the Component Listing pane. Navigate to the Deploy section in the left menu. In the required environment card, click the view icon for the endpoint you want to apply rate limiting to. In the Endpoint Details pane, click the settings icon.

Choreo offers two rate-limiting levels: API-level Rate Limiting: Applies the allocated request count for the specified time unit to all operations in the API. Operation-level Rate Limiting: Allows configuring different rate-limiting values for each operation. When rate limiting is enabled, Choreo provides four response headers: x-ratelimit-limit: Shows the request count allocated for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-reset: Indicates the time remaining to start the next rate-limiting time unit. x-ratelimit-remaining: Shows the remaining request count for the specified time unit. x-ratelimit-enforced: Appears after exceeding the allocated request count.
